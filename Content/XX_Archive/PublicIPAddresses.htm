        <h1>Public IP addresses</h1>
        <p>ClientSpace can integrate with other applications more than ever, and sometimes this requires direct connections to the application, be that a firewall or mail server. To configure many of these settings the IP addresses for the ClientSpace servers are required.</p>
        <p>The ClientSpace install sites are on virtual servers housed in an off-site co-location.  The IP Addresses for the Server installations are:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Cloud1 - 68.64.35.37</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Cloud2 - 68.64.44.9</p>
        <p>If you are unsure which server houses your ClientSpace installation, log an Extranet case.</p>
