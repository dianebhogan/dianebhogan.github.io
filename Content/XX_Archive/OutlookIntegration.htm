        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1 ">Integrating Outlook with <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /></h1>
        <p>One of the best methods of integrating the Organization record in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> with the sales process is through the <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Outlook Add-In Post and Send functionality.&#160;The <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Outlook Add-In allows you to connect emails that you send and receive in MS Outlook to the <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> contact and organization records that you use for Sales prospecting.&#160;When you have installed and configured the Outlook add-in for use, attaching emails to a Contact record in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> is only a click away.&#160;</p>
        <p>Simply create an email to your customer as you normally would in Outlook and when you are done, use the <strong>Post and Send</strong> function of the Outlook add-in to send your email and automatically attach the email to the related contact record in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> at the same time.</p>
        <p>When you click <strong>Post and Send</strong>, the <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Outlook add-in  uses the email addresses in the <b>To</b> and <b>Cc</b> fields of Outlook to look up contacts in your installation of <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> and automatically tie the emails to the appropriate Contact record.&#160;</p>
        <p>Emails received from Client contacts&#160;can be attached to <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> contact records as email activities in a similar way using the <strong>Post to ClientSpace</strong> function in Outlook. This button, available on received emails in Outlook, allows you to attach received emails to <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> contact records, making these emails available from the Activities area of the Organization.</p>
