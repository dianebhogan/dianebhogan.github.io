        <h1>What's new</h1>
        <p style="font-style: italic;"><a name="NewProdName"></a>PrismHR Pulse is now PrismHR ClientSpace!

</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">Why is Pulse changing to ClientSpace?

</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. "><b>Align product name with product vision</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Indent1">The vision for the module when it was launched as PrismHR Pulse and Sense in late 2017 has since evolved in a direction that closely resembles its original design—a powerful CRM for PEOs and ASOs. “ClientSpace” is a clear, descriptive name for this functionality and one already familiar to many in the industry.

</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. "><b>Clarity and consistency</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Indent1">The many names currently used to describe the module (i.e., ClientSpace, Pulse, Pulse and Sense) has created confusion. One descriptive name—PrismHR ClientSpace—will provide clarity and consistency.


</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">Is anything changing in the module as a result of this name change?

</p>
        <p>All the functionality in Pulse remains the same. There is nothing service providers need to do. If you have Pulse, you now have ClientSpace.

We are working to update references in the product and support materials from Pulse to ClientSpace. 
If you have any questions, please contact your Customer Success Manager. </p>
