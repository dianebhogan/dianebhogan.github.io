        <h1>Triggering a Template Task for fields across a tabbed dataset                        
        </h1>
        <p>When triggering a template task for a field that is not on the first tab of a tabbed dataset, it is&#160;necessary&#160;to configure an "AND"&#160;group. &#160;One condition has to be on the primary tab and the other can be the field you want to trigger on.&#160;The first tab is the parent form of the tabbed&#160;dataset.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To trigger a template task:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Determine which field on the tabbed dataform&#160;(the child&#160;dataform)&#160;you would like to trigger the task from.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Determine which&#160;field on the first tab (the parent dataform) that you can also trigger the task from.<br />If there is a required field, this would work best because you can trigger the task on that field being&#160;"not empty."</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Set up the template task following the Template Task Configuration:</p>
        <p class="Bullet2" MadCap:autonum="• ">Error rendering macro 'excerpt-include' : No link could be created for 'Template Task Configuration'.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Be sure that the two trigger conditions have identical AND groups.</p>
