        <h1>Salesforce API&#160;integration v1.2</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the integration of Salesforce into <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> for Salesforce v1.2. The Salesforce API requires a large amount of precision configuration in both Salesforce and <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> including Connectivity configuration and Import and Export mappings. Misconfiguring any of these settings can produce unexpected results and problematic consequences, such as duplicate records. Before you attempt to configure the Salesforce API integration, it is strongly recommended that you log an Extranet case for assistance.</p>
