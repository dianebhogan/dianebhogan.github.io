        <p>Think of an organization as an organizing folder or Rolodex card for storing everything about a potential client.  The organization provides you with a single place to put lead related tasks and calendar events (client visits) as well as  phone calls, emails, and follow ups.</p>
        <p>Lets start by filling out some Demographic information on your prospective client - for the purposes of our example we are going to use the local software manufacturer Monkeysoft.  When you first start approaching a prospective client you may only have some basic information, such as name address and phone number, but that is enough to get you started.</p>
