        <h1>Configuring Email to Case Discussions</h1>
        <p>You can use <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Email Integration to initiate Client Service Case Discussions. How does this work? An external person sends an email to an Email Alias configured mailbox, and a new Client Service Case and Discussion is generated.  You can manage subsequent Discussion Messages by using the ReplyTo link or by replying to the email.  External recipients can click the standard ReplyTo link embedded in the email or they can Reply to the email, and the <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Email Integration process attaches it to the correct Client Service Discussion Thread.</p>
        <p>The <span class="UXElement">Default</span> and <span class="UXElement">EmailIntegration</span> pipelines are both used when using the Email Integration process of created Discussions.  This enables the application to manage Discussion Threads, Recipients, and Messages when delivering notifications in conjunction with Biz Logic.</p>
        <p class="ActionTip">Email Integration to Case Discussions assumes that Email Integration is already configured. See <MadCap:xref href="../Integrations/EmailInteg_Overview.htm" title="Overview of the Email Integration process" alt="Overview of the Email Integration process">Overview of the Email Integration process</MadCap:xref>.</p>
