        <h1>Adding users to the Sales Workspace Group</h1>
        <p>This&#160;document explains how users are added to the Sales&#160;workspace&#160;group.&#160;</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">How  users are added to the Sales workspace group</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> controls which users are placed in the Sales workspace group.&#160;</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">The user in the Assigned To field on the&#160;Organization plus any user&#160;who is in the Admin level role for the Assigned To user's primary department will automatically be added to this workspace group. </p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">This is why sales users as well as their managers always have access to their workspaces.&#160;</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">If&#160;the Assigned To user is changed,&#160;the&#160;previous users in this workspace group will not be removed automatically.&#160;This means these users will still have access to the workspace unless they are manually removed.&#160;</p>
