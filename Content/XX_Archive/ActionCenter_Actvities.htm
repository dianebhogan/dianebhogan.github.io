        <h1>Action Center: Activities
        </h1>
        <p>The Activities area of the Action Center gives you quick access to all activities associated with the Organization at a glance. Activities include Email, Phone Call, Follow Up, and Note.</p>
        <p>Beside each section of the Action Center, you will see a counter badge that indicates a count of the current active activities. When you select the action item, it expands with a mini view showing the date of the activity, activity type, associated contact, and the subject of the activity. The following example shows 3 current activities: two are<img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddFollowUp.png" />(Follow Up) and one is <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddEmail.png" /> (Email).</p>

        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>Email is ubiquitous today and has become one of the primary methods of business communication.&#160;ClientSpace allows you to manage your email communications with prospective clients directly from the Organization record, where you have notes, calls, and follow-up information at your fingertips.</p>
        <h3>Phone Call</h3>
        <p>Keeping track of calls you made or what was said can be a daunting task, especially if you are using mass contact functions such as a marketing campaign to reach a large audience all at once. Through ClientSpace, you can record the subject of your call, what you talked about, who you talked to, the result of the call, and the date.</p>
        <h3>Follow Up</h3>
        <p>Follow Up records are specifically created to provide a reminder for you to contact the&#160;prospective client at a later date either in relation to a previous call or email, or as a direct contact to keep you and your company top of mind for the prospect.&#160;When you add a follow up, it creates a Note record with Follow Up as the default activity type.</p>
        <p>Follow Up records can also be converted to another type of record such as a Phone Call or an Email. When you open the Follow Up activity, the Activity Type is cleared so that you can select a different type.</p>
        <p>The Organizations area of the Home Dashboard in ClientSpace only displays follow ups from <strong style="font-weight: normal;">today</strong> and earlier. If these follow ups are consistently assigned an appropriate activity, such as email or phone call, this section of the home dashboard can be used as a ToDo list of items that should be done by today or prior.</p>
        <h3>Note<br></br></h3>
        <p>When you add a Note, it opens a new Note record to record detailed information about your prospective client.&#160;Using Notes in concert with Email, Phone Call, and Follow Up ensures that you have all the information you gather about a prospective client at your fingertips.</p>
