            <MadCap:concept term="Dataforms" />Dataform Properties</h1>
        <p>Form properties control the basic properties of the SQL table, such as Table Name. After saving the initial dataform, you cannot change the basic properties of the SQL table. Therefore, be sure to plan carefully before you save.&#160;Consider the name of a dataform carefully because the only way to change a table name is to delete the dataform and any data you may have stored in it and start over.</p>
        <p>The field&#160;<strong>Dataform Name</strong>&#160;is simply a label and can be changed after the initial save to provide a more descriptive title of the dataform. However, the best practice is to make the table name as short as possible while still being descriptive. For example, you may want the title of the dataform to read as&#160;<em>Family Medical and Leave Act Data.</em>&#160;A better table name would be <em>gen_zFMLA</em>.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To accomplish this:
        </p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Save the form initially with a dataform name of <strong>FMLA</strong>.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Change the <strong>Dataform Name</strong> field to the more descriptive <strong>Family Medical and Leave Act Data</strong>.</p>
