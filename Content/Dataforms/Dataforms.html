            <p>The heart of the <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> system is configurable dataforms. Dataforms are your workspace building blocks. ClientSpace has been tailored to the unique needs of the PEO industry, primarily using the dataform architecture. Dataforms enable administrators to modify forms or create entirely new forms and sub-systems all without writing a line of code. </p>
        </MadCap:microContent>
        <p>Configurable data management through dataforms&#160;provides some of&#160;the most dynamic and powerful capabilities embedded within ClientSpace. Global administrators can create and maintain configurable web-based data entry forms to match their data management requirements. The dataform schema should be carefully modeled with the same care and strategic mindset as would be taken during the data modeling phase of any custom software development project. With careful planning and implementation, ClientSpace dataforms can provide the tools to design and build the solution most suited to your business needs. </p>
        <p>We’ll start with the basics and together build a form from scratch reviewing all the various properties of the form and field objects as well as the growing variety of data types.  We’ll explain other topics understood by few outside of <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.CompanyName" /> such as dataform security, lookup metadata, and tabbed forms.  Fasten your seat belts, this ride is not for the faint of heart. </p>
        <p class="ActionTip">Dataform administration is a <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Advanced Administrative function and requires Global Admin permission and an Enterprise License.</p>
        <p>This chapter describes dataforms, what happens when they are created or changed, and how they are managed within the application. The following topics are included in this chapter.</p>
