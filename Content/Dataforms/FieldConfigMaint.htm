            <MadCap:concept term="Dataforms" />Configuring Dataform fields</h1>
        <p>Now that you have the container for your data, it's time to start adding the fields to store the individual pieces of information you want to track. Dataform fields can be as simple as a few fields together on a page or can be complex, dynamic groupings of fields that hide or display based on predetermined logic. Taking the time to map out your dataform layout pays off in the overall amount of time you invest in the final version of the dataform.
For more details about dataform fields, see <MadCap:xref href="../Admin_Config/ConfigDynFieldDisp.html" title="Configuring dynamic field display" alt="Configuring dynamic field display">Configuring dynamic field display</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Best practices for field configuration
</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Leave space between your field rows in the numbering scheme should you need to add more fields later (10, 20, 30).</li>
            <li>Restart numbering sequences within each fieldset to group the data elements together visually.</li>
            <li>Fieldsets should have their own numbering sequences independent of the numbering within the fieldsets. 
</li>
            <li>Multiforms require the additional step of configuring columns for the list display. If this is not configured, you receive the error "Column headers have not been defined for this dataform" when you attempt to use the dataform in a workspace.</li>
            <li>You cannot add more than 150 fields to a dataform.</li>
        </ul>
