        <h1>Configuring dynamic field display</h1>
        <p>Configurable field display provides an administrator with vast control over the general look and feel of a dataform. This is much more than just grouping fields into fieldsets or tabs but includes the ability to dynamically enable or disable fields and&#160;show or hide fields, fieldsets,&#160;or even tabbed dataforms based on the other data on that dataform. In combination with custom header links, an administrator can virtually set up any workflow or process in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> using dynamic field display. </p>
        <p>When configuring field display,  keep in mind what you would like to accomplish and map out how the result should work on your dataform. For example, when you select Organization as the Location, Organization fields can be made read-only or hidden based on configurable properties just as dataform fields. The source for these properties can be either based on Organization fields (where Field Source is This Table) or other related fields in ClientSpace using a field display proc (Field display Proc 1 or 2). </p>
        <p>Field display can be cascaded. Combine this with required field rules, and it allows you to build incredibly complex workflows within a dataform. An example of this could be a form, where filling out a Pay Frequency field with a value of <b>Weekly</b> displays a Weekly payroll fieldset containing a&#160;required Pay Type field with values of <b>Check</b> or <b>Direct Deposit</b>. Selecting <b>Direct Deposit</b> displays a field for <b>Bank Authorization</b>, which is also required to save the form.</p>
        <p>Required dataform fields hidden through configurable field display do not present their Required attribute to the system’s dataform save logic, meaning these fields are only required if visible. This allows you to structure complex dataform logic and workflow within a dataform. This flexibility should be tempered with planning to ensure that appropriate data is captured when required. In short, make sure you are not hiding a field that should be completed.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To configure and manage dynamic field display:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <b>System Admin</b> <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_SysAdmin.png" /> &gt; <b>Advanced</b> &gt; <b>Manage Field Display</b>.<br />The Field Display Rule Search dashboard opens. It is helpful to filter the presented list for the dataform to which you are adding field display. This helps you to understand the existing field display logic and determine if this affects the changes you want to make.<br /></li>
            <li>When ready, click <b>Add</b>.<br />The Field Display Rule Detail form opens. This form provides a number of configuration options to customize your field display.<br /></li>
        </ol>
