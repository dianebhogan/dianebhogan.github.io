        <p>Sales activities are&#160;the records of the sales calls and actions&#160;you perform as part of the sales process.&#160;Managing multiple prospects can be daunting unless you have the right tools  to&#160;help you remember who did what and when.&#160;Being able to record these sales activities quickly and easily  is what the Activities icons are all about. Throughout the sales process, you may need to record many contact events with the potential client.&#160;These events are recorded as Activities using the Action Center. </p>
        <p>Activities are managed in the Action Center, under the Activities section. Counter badges display a count of the activities. Additionally, the Activities icons are helpful visuals to record Emails <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddEmail.png" />, Phone Calls <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddPhoneCall.png" />, Follow Ups<img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddFollowUp.png" />, and Notes <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddNote.png" />. You can also View Full Search <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Search.png" /> and View Summary.</p>
        <p>From here you can add and track activities.</p>
