        <h1>Layers</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> is built in a series of software layers. </p>
        <h2>Core</h2>
        <p>Core is the most basic of the layers. Core provides basic customer relationship management (CRM) functionality, as well as the lead management and client service modules. This layer is extremely powerful – the foundation of all <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> functionality. The foundation layer includes our powerful dataform engine, workflow engine, data integration tools, and reporting and dashboards. Using the tools available, we can build elaborate systems to help manage your business.</p>
        <h2>PEO</h2>
        <p>A&#160;PEO is a professional employer organization, which is an outsourcing firm that supplies services to small and medium-sized business. The PEO layer of <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> provides end-to-end
enterprise management. So how does it work?
Qualified leads become
prospects, which then generates a workspace. Sales staff submit a deal to underwriting. Next, sales signs the deal with the client. This event activates the client and generates a client workspace.</p>
        <h2>Custom</h2>
        <p>Overlying the Core and PEO products is the custom or candy layer of the software.  This layer is client-specific and includes custom dataforms, business rules, and reports, used by our clients to make <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> their own.</p>
