        <p>Let's face it, your business is complicated. <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> was designed to help manage the day-to-day of your business to keep track of all those loose ends that make your business work, which means <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> can be complicated too. <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> functions as your command center where you can see everything that is going on with your clients and take action.

        <h2>Alerts and notifications</h2>
        <p>Receive instant notifications of important data changes and events so you can act rather than waiting for an employee to contact you with an issue. Receive alerts to your <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Inbox (through email) and to all your devices (through Slack). Alerts are entirely customizable—choose which alerts you receive and how you want to see them. See <MadCap:xref href="../Notifications/SystemNotifications.html" title="[%=MyVariables.ProductName%] notifications" alt="[%=MyVariables.ProductName%] notifications">[%=MyVariables.ProductName%] notifications</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Case management</h2>
        <p>Resolve issues reported by your small and midsize business clients more quickly. It is easy for both clients and your team to create tickets and assign tasks to stay on track. Cases can be organized based on category and type and can be configured as templates to ensure your team manages common issues consistently.</p>
        <h2>Task management</h2>
        <p>Split cases into manageable chunks to keep your team organized and focused on what is important. Tasks are flexible and configured to align with the way your team works. For example, you may choose to deploy tasks sequentially, so a new task initiates only after the preceding step completes. Or, kick off a series of tasks all at once.</p>
        <h2>Workflows</h2>
        <p>Improve reaction time and coordination across your team with workflows that can be set up to match your business processes and automate task assignment. Workflows help each team member know what they need to focus on next and prioritize their to-do lists. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Screen">See <MadCap:xref href="../WFC/Introduction.htm" title="Workflow Channels" alt="Workflow Channels">Workflow Channels</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h2>Dashboards</h2>
        <p>Quickly see and report on what is most important to you. Whether it is cases and tasks completed or other sales and client service metrics, it is easy to measure your team’s performance. Dashboards are typically configured by role but can be customized by the individual.</p>
