        <h1>Case escalation</h1>
        <p>Case Escalation Level 1 and 2 dates and times are set when the case is first saved. Escalation dates get re-set if Priority, Category, or Case Type is changed as this can affect the valid escalation parameters. </p>
        <p>These fields are read-only by default but can be editable and secured for more flexibility. As long as the case is open and there are escalation dates and time filled in, this case is found on the Case Escalation Email. Inactivating an Escalation record has no impact on whether the Escalation dates based on that record are set or not.
