        <p>For case-centric organizations, cases are the primary method for tracking client interactions and issues. Using cases, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Centralize communications with the client, keeping everyone on the same page.</li>
            <li>Make internal cooperation easier through case reassignment.</li>
            <li>Provide a consistent way of recording client contacts through standardized forms and customizable workflows.</li>
            <li>Always know who is responsible for resolving client issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="StepResult">&#160;</p>
        <p>For task-centric organizations, all work is tracked and assigned with the task. Tasks can stand on their own or can be a child to a parent case. Tasks are configurable assignment items with an Owner and Assigned To person and defined start and end dates.  If you only use tasks with no parent case, then as work is completed, you can assign the task to the next person. For work that has no dependencies, you can create multiple tasks.</p>
