        <h1>Subscribing to case type subscriptions</h1>
        <p>Some case types are more time sensitive than others. One way to keep up with particular case types is through subscriptions. You can subscribe to an individual case by adding yourself to the notification list on the case itself. However. the most efficient way receive notifications on cases of a particular type is through the <b>Case Type Subscriptions</b> module.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> provides the ability to select Case Type subscriptions (within security limits), which means you can subscribe to a given case type and if you have security appropriate to see the case type, you are notified when cases of this type are created.</p>
        <p>  This topic describes Case Type Subscriptions and how to manage them through the Case Type Subscriptions module. The Case Type Subscriptions module allows you to subscribe to specific case types either by:<br /></p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Individual <strong>workspace</strong> (filtered by the workspaces to which the selected user has access),</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Or by selecting <strong>My Clients</strong>, which subscribes the user to the selected case type for any workspace where they are a member of the <strong>Client Team</strong> role in workspace security settings.&#160;</p>
        <p>The Case Type Subscription module displays a list of subscriptions for the current user. From this module you can add, edit, or delete case type subscriptions so that you can easily customize the case notifications you receive.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To subscribe to a case:</p>
