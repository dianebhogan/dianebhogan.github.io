            <MadCap:concept term="Cases" />Reassigning cases</h1>
        <p> If you have taken a case about as far as you can and you need someone else to work it, simply change the assignment to that person. Changing case assignment means that you are passing the responsibility of the case to the person to whom you are assigning it. Following the rules of case communications, you should provide a brief overview of what you have done so far and also provide an explanation of why they are being assigned the case and what you expect the person to do.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To reassign a case:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">From an open case, in the <b>Case Assignment</b> fieldset, click <b>Assigned To</b>.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">A list of users displays.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Select a user.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="3. ">On <b>Internal Notes</b>, click <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Add.png" />.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The field opens, ready for you to type.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Provide notes for the newly assigned user and click  <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Add.png" /> again.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Click <b>Apply</b>.</p>
        <p>When you reassign a case, it no longer appears in your default search under the Case Search dashboard because the default search is filtered for you.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To remove the filter:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">From the <b>Cases</b> search list, click  <b>Assigned To</b>.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">This action removes the Assigned To filter. You can now see that the case is still in the system.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">To reset the filter, click <b>Reset</b>.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The Assigned To filter is restored.</p>
        <p>You can remove the filter default to see the case. Cases assigned to you automatically show up under your default search.</p>
