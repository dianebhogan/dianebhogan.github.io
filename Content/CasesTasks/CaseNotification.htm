        <h1>Case notification</h1>
        <p>Case communication is important because it keeps everyone on the same page, maintains a consistent information trail, and gives you one place  to find information about an issue or client communication. When you save changes to a case, all subscribers automatically receive an email about the change. The integration of cases with communication saves you a step of recording the discussion in the case and then recording it again in an email.
By consistently using case communications, you can create reports that paint a picture of how many and what types of requirements each client may have. 
</p>
        <p>When a case is created or modified, the following users receive notifications of the change:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>Assigned To</b> user on the case.</li>
            <li>Any <b>Notify User</b> specified on the case.</li>
            <li>Members of the <b>Notification Role</b> configured on the associated Case Type.</li>
            <li>Users that have subscribed to that <b>Case Type</b>, <b>Workspace</b>, or <b>Case</b>.<ul><li>External Case Creators always have access to view the cases they create, if the Case Type remains one that is exposed to external users.</li><li>The list of users available for Case Type Subscription comprises Global Admins and any user that is in a role with Edit rights to the <b>gen_AdminCaseTypes</b> form.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Admin-level users of associated Department role for the <b>Assigned To</b> user (on critical case when it is being created.)</li>
        </ul>
