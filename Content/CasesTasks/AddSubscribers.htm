        <h1>Adding subscribers</h1>
        <p>You can add Subscribers to any case, which automatically notifies the selected people through email and the notification system within <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />. 

Use notifications judiciously. Notifications can quickly go from keeping people who need to know in the loop to unnecessarily spamming people unrelated to a client issue.

</p>

</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
From an open Case, in the <b>Action Center</b>, expand <b>Subscribers</b>.
</li>
            <li>Click <b>Select Subscribers</b>.
