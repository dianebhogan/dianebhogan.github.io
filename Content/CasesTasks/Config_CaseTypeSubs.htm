        <h1>Configuring case type subscriptions</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> provides the ability to select Case Type subscriptions (within security limits), which means you can subscribe to a given case type and if you have security appropriate to see the case type you will be notified when cases of this type are created.  This topic describes Case Type Subscriptions and how to manage them through the Case Type Subscriptions module.</p>
        <p>An administrative Case Type Subscriptions  allows users to subscribe to specific case types either by individual workspace (filtered by the workspaces to which the selected user has access ) or by selecting My Clients, which subscribes the user to the selected case type for any workspace where they are a member of the Client Team role in workspace security settings.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To configure case type subscriptions:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">From the modules bar, select <b>Case Type Subscriptions</b>. You may need to select it from the View list.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The Case Type Subscriptions dashboard opens.</p>
