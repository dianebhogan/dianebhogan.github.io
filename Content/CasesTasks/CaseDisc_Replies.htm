        <h1>Replying to case discussions</h1>
        <p>When a Case Discussion message is sent, the message is delivered to the recipient's email mailbox, such as Outlook or Gmail. Users could have two options for replying to case discussions:&#160;Send a Reply link or the Reply button. </p>
        <p class="ActionTip">Using the Reply button requires additional configuration. Consult with your <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> administrator.</p>
        <h2>Reply options</h2>
        <p>When replying to a case discussion, users can either:&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <span class="UXElement">Send a Reply</span> link within the email message. This functionality is always available.</li>
            <li>Click the standard <span class="UXElement">Reply</span> button from the email mailbox. This functionality requires additional <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> configuration by your <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> administrator. </li>

        <h3>Replying directly from the email mailbox with Reply</h3>
        <p>To use the <span class="UXElement">Reply</span> button from your mailbox, <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> requires additional configuration using an Email Integration that is explicitly tied to email templates CSCDISC and CSCDISCNEW. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Screen">See <MadCap:xref href="Config_CaseDiscAboveLine.htm" title="Configuring Case Discussion Replies Above the Line" alt="Configuring Case Discussion Replies Above the Line">Configuring Case Discussion Replies Above the Line</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Print">See the topic <em>Configuring Case Discussion Replies Above This Line</em> in the <em>Setup &amp;&#160;Administration Guide</em>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <p>When you click <span class="UXElement">Send a Reply</span> or the <span class="UXElement">Reply</span> button (requires additional configuration), you are automatically connected to ClientSpace and taken to the case discussion thread.

From here, you can reply to the message by selecting a reply template (if applicable), typing in any customized notes, and selecting your recipients. A Reply Template list is available if any are configured for your organization. Templates provide standardized Subject and Message content for specific scenarios, such as payroll responses. Your <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> administrator configures email templates.</p>
