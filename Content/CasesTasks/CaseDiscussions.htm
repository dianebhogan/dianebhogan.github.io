        <h1>Adding case discussions</h1>
        <p>Case discussions allow you to communicate effectively with your clients in a conversational manner, directly from the case that they log. When you use case discussions, you can keep much of the communication outside of the case but still connected should you need to reference the discussions. The immediacy of case discussions allows you to submit your information to the client in email format, which is easier for them to receive and makes it more conversational.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To create a case discussion:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Open a client service case.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The Client Service case form opens.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Select a <b>Client Contact</b>.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">This action automatically fills Reported By and Email Address. A best practice is always to select a client contact when possible.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="3. ">In the <b>Action Center</b>, expand <b>Links</b> &lt; <b>More</b>, and click <b>Discuss</b> or <b>Case Discussions</b>.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The Discussion Thread form opens. Notice at the top is where a running history of your conversation with the client is displayed. The discussion has two tabs: <b>Message</b> and <b>Recipients</b>. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">

        </p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To compose the message:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">From the <b>Message</b> tab, enter a <b>Subject</b>.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">In <b>Comments</b>, enter your message.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The comments field supports advanced formatting options, including font selection, size and color, as well as additional formatting, such as bold, italics, bullet points, and so on.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To add an attachment:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">To add an attachment to the discussion, click <b>Choose File</b>.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The Open dialog box opens.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Locate the file and click <b>Open</b>.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="3. ">To save the attachment, click <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <p>The next step is to select the recipient.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To select the recipients:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Click the <b>Recipients</b> tab.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">This is where you select whom to include in the discussion thread. The Recipients tab has an area for Available Recipients and Currently Selected Recipients. You can choose from Contacts, Employees, and Users (your co-workers). Contacts for this client are readily available for you in the Contacts tab. You can also use Search Contacts associated with the Organization. </p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Select a contact by selecting the check box beside the entry. <br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">As you select a contact, the recipients are listed in the adjacent panel, <b>Currently Selected Recipients</b>.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Navigating/CaseDisc_Recipients.png" alt="" title="" class="thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="3. ">To remove recipients from the list, click <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_RemoveBlack.png" /> (<b>Remove</b>).</p>
        <p>For Employees, you can also select their work or personal email account. By default, the employee's work email is selected. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To change the recipient's email (work to personal):</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">In the <b>Currently Selected Recipients</b> list, locate the employee and click <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_JumpActionCenter.png" />  (this action exposes the employee's email account list).<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The selected employee's work and personal email accounts display. The work email is selected by default.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">To switch to the employee's personal email, select the personal email option.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Case/CaseDiscussChangeRecipientEmail.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Now you are ready to send the message.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To send the message:</p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">On the <b>Message</b> tab, review your comments, recipients, and any attached files.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Click <b>Send Reply</b>.</p>
        <h2>Discussion messages</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Case/CaseDisc_counter.png" class="left" />
        </p>
        <p>As you add discussions to a case, in the Action Center, the Discussion counter increments, showing you how many discussions are attached to the case. Discussions have  threads – there can be multiple messages within a thread, and multiple threads within a Discussion. The counter displays the total number of messages and an <span class="UXElement">*</span> for inactive messages should there be any.</p>
        <h2>What happens next</h2>
        <p class="TableBullet" MadCap:autonum="• ">When you click <span class="UXElement">Send Reply</span> from the New Message To box, an email is sent to the recipients. </p>
        <p class="TableBullet" MadCap:autonum="• ">When the recipients open their email, they see a link in the email message, <span class="UXElement">Send a Reply</span>. Clicking the link takes them to the discussion for the case, where the recipients can add comments and Send Reply. See <MadCap:xref href="CaseDisc_Replies.htm" title="Case Discussion Replies" alt="Case Discussion Replies">Case Discussion Replies</MadCap:xref>. Alternatively, if Email Integration is configured (consult your <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> administrator), users can click the email Reply button. </p>
        <p class="TableBullet" MadCap:autonum="• ">The original sender of the message also receives a response directly in the case discussion, which they can then review. At this point, the discussion thread starts to build, showing who has been notified, the subject of the discussion, and how many messages are currently attached.</p>
        <p class="TableBullet" MadCap:autonum="• ">Additionally, you can create a new discussion for new subjects.</p>
