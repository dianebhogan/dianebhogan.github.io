        <h1>Subscribing client team members to cases</h1>
        <p>While viewing a case, you can easily add client team members as subscribers to the case. From the list of workspace users, you can use Quick Search and More search to find users quickly and save your search. You can verify the client team from within any workspace.   Additionally, when you add a user to a team role, it automatically makes them available for selection as a subscriber.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To add client team members as subscribers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a Client Service Case.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="UXElement">Action Center</span>, expand <span class="UXElement">Subscribers</span> and click <span class="UXElement">Select Subscribers</span>.<br />The Select Users list displays. The list comprises client team members and workspace users. Note the Client Team Role column.</li>
            <li>From here, you can use <span class="UXElement">Quick Search</span>:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Full Name (starts with)</li><li>First Name (starts with)</li><li>Last Name (starts with)</li><li>Client Team Role (starts with)</li><li>Email address (%)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Use <span class="UXElement">More</span> search to search by:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li> Department</li><li>Client Team Role</li><li>Client Team Member (enable the option)</li></ul></li>
            <li>From the Users list, highlight the row, and in the <span class="UXElement">Select</span> column, select the check box. Alternatively, click <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Jump.png" /> (Open). The user is selected. You can select multiple users.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="UXElement">Ok</span>.<br />You are returned to the Client Service Case. The selected user is now listed as a Subscriber. For users with multiple roles, the roles are comma-separated, as in the following example.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/Case/Subscribe-Users.png" class="thumbnail" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <span class="UXElement">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ActionTip">When users are deleted, they are no longer subscribers to the case. If a Client Team Role changes, the case displays the old user as a subscriber. For example, if the Benefits Specialist role changes from Sally Jones to Will Baker. Sally will continue to show as a subscriber because you add the user as a subscriber and not the role.</p>
