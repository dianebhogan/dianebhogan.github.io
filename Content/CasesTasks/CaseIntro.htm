        <h1>Cases</h1>
        <p> Cases help you manage assignments and resolve issues - whether they are for internal to your organization or relate to client issues. Case types are a way to group cases so that you can manage the  resolution by more effectively managing by types.  Case discussions allow you to communicate effectively with your clients in a conversational manner, directly from the case that they log. When you use case discussions, you can keep much of the communication outside of the case but still connected should you need to reference the discussions.</p>
