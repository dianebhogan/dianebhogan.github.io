        <p>For most PEOs, proper management of Workers’ Compensation risk is a foundational competency that will have a significant impact on profitability. ClientSpace provides an ideal platform to enter the first report of injury and manage the claim  through to closure. Integration with payroll systems and the ability to automatically load loss runs from the carrier get most risk managers  excited about the possibilities.  Throw in policy management, COIs, analytics, and profitability reporting, and they are hooked.</p>
