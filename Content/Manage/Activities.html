        </p>
        <p>The <b>Activities</b> area of the <b>Action Center</b> gives you quick access to all activities associated with the Organization at a glance. Activities include <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddEmail.png" /> Email, <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddPhoneCall.png" /> Phone Call, <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddFollowUp.png" /> Follow Up, <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_AddNote.png" /> Note, <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Search.png" /> View Full Search, and View Summary. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Screen">For details, see <MadCap:xref href="../Sales/OrgContactsActivities.html">Managing&#160;your leads: Organizations, Contacts, and Activities</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>In addition to managing activities, <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> provides a counter to indicate the number of current active activities. When you expand Activities,  a mini panel  provides the date of the activity, activity type (indicated by the corresponding icon), associated contact, and the subject of the activity.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Email</span> is ubiquitous today and has become one of the primary methods of business communication.&#160;<MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> allows you to manage your email communications with prospective clients directly from the Organization record, where you have notes, calls, and follow-up information at your fingertips. Email activity shows the origin of the activity as ClientSpace, Salesforce (through the API), or the Email Add In<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Screen"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../AddIns/Create_ActCasesTasks.htm" title="Creating activities, cases, and tasks from your Outlook email" alt="Creating activities, cases, and tasks from your Outlook email">Creating activities, cases, and tasks from your Outlook email</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. This additional information provides insight into activities created through these paths.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Phone Call</span>: Keeping track of calls you made and the conversation can be a daunting task, especially if you are using mass contact functions such as a marketing campaign to reach a broad audience all at once. Through <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />, you can record the subject of your call, what you talked about, whom you talked to, the result of the call, and the date.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Follow Up</span> records  provide a reminder for you to contact the&#160;prospective client  later either concerning a previous call or email or as a direct contact to keep you and your company top of mind for the prospect.&#160;When you add a Follow Up, it creates a Note record with Follow Up as the default activity type.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="TableTextLeft">Follow Up records can also be converted to another type of record such as a Phone Call or an Email. When you open the Follow Up activity, the Activity Type is cleared so that you can select a different type.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="TableTextLeft">The Organizations area of the Home Dashboard in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> only displays Follow Ups from today and earlier. If these Follow Ups are consistently assigned an appropriate activity, such as Email or Phone Call, this section of the Home dashboard can be used as a ToDo list of items that should be done by today or prior.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you add a <span class="UXElement">Note</span>, it opens a new Note record to record detailed information about your prospective client.&#160;Using Notes in concert with Email, Phone Call, and Follow Up ensures that you have all the information you gather about a prospective client at your fingertips.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">View Full Search</span> allows you to view all activities for an organization to include active and inactive records. It displays a full list of available records. The full search is available through the <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Search.png" /> icon.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">View Summary</span> provides a one-stop-shop for managing activities through a dashboard, showing all activities associated with the Organization.  Selecting an activity in the left pane provides a detailed view of the activity on the right.  The activity list can be filtered, allowing you a quick method of reviewing all activities.</p>
