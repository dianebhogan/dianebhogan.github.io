        <p>Widgets deliver targeted information within ClientSpace and, therefore, can deliver what is most important to you when you need it. <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> home page widgets can be tailored to your needs, based on the priority, conditions, and security settings of the configured widget. Widget target types determine where the widget layout displays. For your home page, you can select the Home target type, available in the Action Center.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To select a Home Page:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From your home page, in the <span class="UXElement">Action Center</span>, expand <span class="UXElement">Home Pages</span>.<br />All home pages that are available to you display in the list.</li>
            <li>Select an entry.<br />The home page layout changes.</li>
            <li>To pin the layout as your default, in the <span class="UXElement">Action Center</span> toolbar, click <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Pin.png" /> (<span class="UXElement">Current Default Home Page</span>).<br />The pin changes to a green check and then back to the pin icon.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>When pinned, the home page is the default.</li><li>When no pinned widget is selected, the system defaults the home page based on conditions, with the greatest weighted one as the default.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note that widget configuration has not changed and is administered in System Admin &gt;&#160;Widget Layouts. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Screen">For more details about widgets, conditions, weighting, and security settings, see <MadCap:xref href="../Widgets/WidgetLayouts.html" title="Widget layouts" alt="Widget layouts">Widget layouts</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Print">For more details about widgets, conditions, weighting, and security settings, see the <em>ClientSpace Setup &amp;&#160;Administration Guide</em>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
