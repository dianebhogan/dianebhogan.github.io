            <h1>Work Center</h1>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> clients work with many pieces of information and realize that multitasking is essential. The <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> design provides multitasking capabilities through the Work Center,  located on the left side of the application. The Work Center menu is your primary tool for multitasking – it provides a hierarchical display of multiple open workspaces and work items at any given time.</p>

            <p class="StepResult">&#160;</p>
            <p>To simplify navigation, when you have multiple <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> browser tabs open, the tabs reflect  the active work item. For example, if Contact Search is the active work item, then your browser tab will reflect the same. This feature helps you to quickly identify where you want to go when you have multiple browser tabs open.</p>

        <h2>Work Center icons</h2>
        <p>At the top of the Work Center, you see the icons Home, Inbox, Calendar, and Help.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Workcenter/Icons.png" alt="" title="" />
        </p>
        <p>Below the icons, as you navigate and open forms and dashboards, you will see Work items, Sub-items, and Work item sets.</p>
        <h3>Work items</h3>
        <p>A work item is any item that opens under the menu on the left  side of your browser. These can be various modules that you open from the top modules bar. As you open them, you see that it creates unique work items. If  you try to open a second copy of a work item, the system lets you know that  you already have that item open and asks if you would like to navigate to the existing item or create a new copy.</p>
        <h3>Work item sets</h3>
        <p>Work items are organized as separate levels, where the topmost level known as <b>sets</b> provides multiple <b>thread</b> and <b>sub-thread</b> items. Thread items are indented below the set of items, and sub-thread items are further indented below threads.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Workcenter/WorkCenter_Menu.png" class="left" />
        </p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Sets</span> are the topmost levels, represented by the dark shaded bars. The example shows four sets: Task Manager, Filches Fish Market, Contact Search, and Employee.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Threads</span> are displayed under the Sets and are the individual cases or tasks opened from their respective set. Threads  display a count of the associated open sub-thread items. In the example, a thread count is associated with Contact and Employee.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Sub-threads</span> display under a Thread. An example of sub-threads would be a task opened from one of the cases, or a time tracking item opened from a task.</p>
        <p>Work items appear as you open cases, tasks, workspaces, organizations, and contacts. They  represent open cases, tasks, lists, and so on.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To navigate work items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To view an open item, select an entry.</li>
            <li>To close an open item, click <b>X</b>.</li>
            <li>To collapse the space at the bottom of each set, click <b>^</b> (caret symbol).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
