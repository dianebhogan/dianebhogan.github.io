        <h1>Action Items</h1>
        <p>Action items are displayed in the Action Center and enable navigation to links, reports, notes, attachments, and time tracking items. The contents of the Action Center change based on the current active work object in the Work Center. For example, an open Organization has an Action Center that contains Contacts, Activities, Appointments, Tasks, Attachments, and Security. In contrast, a Workspace landing page may only contain Links, Reports, Tasks, and&#160;Activities.</p>
        <p>Across the application, the Action Items  work in the same way. These items are a series of collapsible objects such as Links, Reports, Tasks, Activities, and so on. The  following image and numbered items describe the navigation.</p>
