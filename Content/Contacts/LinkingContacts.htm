        <h1>Linking contacts: Employees and Users</h1>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Employees</span>: You can link Contacts to Employee records in the system.  This allows the employee to be included in system notifications, such as calendar events.  If a contact already exists for an employee, they can be linked by simply selecting the appropriate contact on the employee record.  If no contact exists for the employee, you can add a contact the option to Add Contact from this same field.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Users</span>: Contacts can also be linked to user records with the Create User functionality.   On the Contract record, when Create User  is selected, and the record is saved, the system generates a user record using contact information such as First Name, Last Name, Phone, Email, and associated Organization. This information is combined with the user profile settings from a pre-designated Contact User Template to generate a user record that is automatically linked to the contact from which it was created.</p>
