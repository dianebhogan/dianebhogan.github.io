        <h1>Managing Inbox notifications</h1>
        <p>All throughout the day when using <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> you get notifications. Task items you need to attend to, Cases that have been updated – they all vie for your attention. But if you have to jump out to email to read them, it slows you down. To streamline this process, we included the notification center in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />. This allows you to keep up to date on those important <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> notifications without the distraction of jumping over to email. This topic provides an overview of managing your notifications in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />. </p>
        <p>Due to the volume of notifications that could be generated to the logged in user just by using <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />, we have limited the number of actions that create Self notifications – these are notifications to the user that triggered the notification occurrence.  The actions that trigger self notifications include:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• "><b>Calendar</b>: Calendar events you create, notify you, allowing you to add them to your mail service calendar.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• "><b>User</b>: User events, such as new accounts, or your password expiring/being changed notifies you.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• "><b>Marketing campaigns</b>: Automatically sent notifications from Marketing campaigns created by you also notify you.</p>
        <p>When you first receive a notification alert, it displays as a transparent bubble message in the work items area.  These alerts are designed to provide a brief introduction to the notification, allowing you to decide whether  it needs to be addressed immediately. Reading these items, marks them as read, removing them from the Quick View and incrementing the Quick View counter down by one.</p>
        <h2>Inbox</h2>
        <p>For those of us who get more than a few notifications a day, the Inbox is a better way to manage them as it provides more detailed information at a glance, as well as a way to mass update the list. </p>
