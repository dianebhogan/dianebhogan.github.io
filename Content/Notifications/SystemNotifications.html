        <h1><MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> notifications</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> notifications feature provides up-to-date information about what's going on within your organization. Notifications include items such as cases, tasks, work items, and email. It can be difficult to switch between the various screens, that is where system notifications can help you stay organized. As notifications are posted, you see a visual indicator and a counter badge on the Inbox. Critical notifications are flagged in red.</p>
        <p>From the Home page, notifications are displayed in two areas:</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Critical unread notifications appear on the right under Announcements. These messages continue to show as critical until they are dismissed.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Inbox notifications appear on the left. These are messages that are sent to you as the <i>To</i> recipient.</p>
        <p class="StepResult">&#160;</p>
