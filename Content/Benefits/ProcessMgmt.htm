        <h1>Process Management</h1>
        <p>Process management includes internal administration, renewals, interfacing with your payroll system, and reconciliation.</p>
        <h2>Administration processes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the Client is matched up to the best plan for both them and you.</li>
            <li>Ensure that Employee elections translate to smooth carrier enrollment and payroll system setup.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Change management</h3>
        <p>Change management is essential to managing benefits dollars. Are your current benefits administration processes supporting the effort of benefits reconciliation? Or are they setting you up for a big surprise? This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New client enrollments</li>
            <li>Employee additions</li>
            <li>Employee eligibility</li>
            <li>Open enrollment and plan renewal</li>
            <li>Employee terminations</li>
            <li>Client terminations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> to manage the madness by configuring your processes through Workflow Channels to generate tasks based on triggers.</p>
        <h2>Renewal management</h2>
        <p>Managing renewals involves automating your processes using Workflow Channels. You can schedule tasks or cases from Benefits Batch and Offered Plan, which can be very beneficial when it comes to process management and auditing. You can use ad hoc reports to track which employees have made their elections at renewal time and which still need to be completed.</p>
        <h2><MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> and PrismHR API: Payroll system</h2>
        <p>The PrismHR API provides two-way communication between ClientSpace and the PrismHR payroll system for Client and Employee data. ClientSpace integrates with PrismHR and can import your data from the PrismHR&#160;payroll system to the Offered Plans dataform in ClientSpace. For details about the API, see <MadCap:xref href="../Payroll/PayrollBatch.htm" title="Payroll Batch information" alt="Payroll Batch information">Payroll Batch information</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>The primary function of ClientSpace is administration and process management. It is a very comprehensive system for administering benefits and related processes. If you use ClientSpace for pricing, quoting, and underwriting, then you can use ClientSpace as a tool to audit your payroll system with Business Intelligence reports. Also, your implementation team and payroll processors should be using ClientSpace as the reference when setting up benefits in your payroll system.</p>
