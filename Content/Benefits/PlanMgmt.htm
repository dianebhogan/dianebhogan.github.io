        <p><span class="UXElement">Master benefits plans</span> are set up in the Admin Workspace. These plans can be assigned to each client or prospect as offered benefits plans. The type of plan determines the plan summary fields that become available.</p>

        <p><span class="UXElement">Premium versus true cost</span>: It is typical in master plans to have a markup on your premium so that you can track what you quoted (and should be billing) your clients, and compare this to what you are liable to the carrier. The category of the plan determines what plan summary fields become available.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Model Benefits Plans</span> are located in the Admin Workspace and are template plans for commonly used client level benefits plans. They are set up  with all of the details filled in except for the premium.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Client Level Benefits Plans</span> are added directly to the prospect or client workspace. This is where you would use a model plan to copy a plan from the Admin Workspace to a client level plan.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Rate Groups</span> are typically A&#160;through E rankings. However, they can sometimes be a Risk Factor percentage. You can set up groups on master plans. Or, if you need to manage banded plans, you can also add rate groups to client level plans. It supports premium versus true cost. First, you must set up and manage Rate Groups through a dataform, which is related to the Benefit Plan. Rate Groups can be configured as a percentage of the premium or as a specific premium amount per coverage level (EE, ES, EC, EK, EF).</p>
