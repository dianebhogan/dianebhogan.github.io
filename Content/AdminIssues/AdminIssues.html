                <p><b>Problem</b>: Open a Client Workspace and go to Employees and one or more of the employees in the list appear to have duplicate records.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Inner Join in List Select statement causing multiple rows to come back due to multiple active Employment records.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Inactivate the appropriate Employment record.</p>
                <p>To inactivate the appropriate Employment record, you must first understand how the historical employment records are generated.  When a change for an employee job history (employment) record arrives in the system, the original record is cloned, and then inactivated. The original record is then updated to reflect the new changes before being saved.  This process should leave only one record in the system with the IsActive flag selected.  Sometimes however this process may fail, leaving multiple employment records marked as IsActive.</p>
                <p>The Employee dataform list will erroneously join the employee once to each of these records, resulting in a list containing seemingly duplicate employees when there is in fact only one employee records and multiple employment records.  </p>
                <p class="ProcedureIntro">To correct the issue:</p>
                <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Open one of the employee records.</p>

                <p><b>Solution</b>: The Create Prospect link has its own security and logic behind it that determines how it presents. For this link to be available, the user must have edit rights to the organization, either through their user or a role in which they are a member being present on the security tab of the organization with Edit rights to that Org.  There is also template logic that determines how the link will react when selected. If the user has access to a single template, the Create Prospect link will create a workspace from that template.  If the user has access to multiple templates, the Create Prospect link will present the user with a list of these template workspaces and allow them to choose which one to clone.  There are two security Entities that come into play in the PEO system for displaying and populating the Create Prospect link: the <b>CRM</b> entity as well as the <b>template_YourTemplateName_member</b> entity.</p>

                <p><b>Problem</b>: When reviewing Client payroll statistics information, you find the PayPeriod amounts are double, triple or even more times greater than they should be.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Missing data fields on the Voucher import records, or mis-configured Import Configs cause the fkPayrollStatisticsID to not get updated, which in turn causes dupe Payroll Statistics records to be produced.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: The process that generates the Payroll Statistics records and updates the vouchers uses many concurrent Voucher record fields to tie these records together - these fields include Voucher.State, Voucher.CompCode,, Voucher.STARTDATE,  Voucher.ENDDATE, Voucher.PAYDATE, AND Voucher.PAYCYCLE.  If any of these fields are missing either from the Import Config, or the Voucher record that is being produced from the payroll system, the Voucher updates will fail.

                <p><b>Solution</b>: Because of the way the links are generated in the right navigation menu, this link needs to be Pinned Open.

                <p><b>Problem</b>: You have submitted a deal for pricing but realize the Contract Type or Legal Entity listed on the Client Master is incorrect.  When you attempt to edit these fields, even as a Global Admin, they are read-only.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Contract Type and Legal Entity settings can factor into pricing, and can change pricing dramatically, so these fields are locked by design during the submission process.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Re-price the deal.  Re-pricing a deal effectively resets it, unlocking these fields for edit.</p>

                <p><b>Cause</b>: Missing Organization Access</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Because Activities are tied to the Organization record,  for a user to access those notes they need not only the CRM entity on one of their user roles, but access to the organizations in question. If this is a Sales user, this access automatically shows up as they create Organizations and associated Workspaces. For Non-Sales, internal users, they need to either be added to the security tab of the Organizations for which they need CRM Note access or added to a role that has CRM Admin access.</p>
