            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Problem</b>: A user attempts to create a case or task from the Outlook add in and they receive the error "Error: pwInternetExplorerRequiredException - Internet Explorer Required".  When checked they are on an appropriate version of Internet Explorer and the browser settings appear correct.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Microsoft will often push changes to Internet Explorer through Windows updates that can cause unexpected behavior in the browser.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Update to the latest version of the browser and check to ensure the update did not overwrite any of the browser configuration settings.  This error is most commonly caused by the compatibility mode settings getting changed.</p>
                <p>Additional considerations for Internet Explorer 10+: With Internet Explorer 10 and up, Microsoft made some major changes to the way the browser handles JavaScript and other web technologies, which can cause unexpected behavior in the application. To avoid these issues, you should set your browser to use compatibility mode for the ClientSpace application. </p>
                <p class="ProcedureIntro">Set Compatibility mode  through the following steps:</p>
                <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Open Internet Explorer and go to your ClientSpace login page – some users have reported that the login page does not load under I.E. 10, that is OK, we just need to get the URL from the browsers address bar.</p>

                    <img src="../Resources/Images/Issues/IE_getURL.png" />

                <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Select the domain portion of the URL. In the example this would be clientspace.net, your install may be different. </p>
                <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="3. ">In Internet Explorer, go to the tools menu:</p>
                <p class="Bullet2" MadCap:autonum="• ">If you do not have an Option for Tools, right-click the top of your browser and ensure the Menu Bar is selected. </p>
                <p class="Bullet2" MadCap:autonum="• ">Then go to <b>Tools</b> &gt; <b>Compatibility View Settings</b>.</p>
                <p class="Bullet2" MadCap:autonum="• ">Add the domain portion of the URL that you just selected into the <b>Add this website:</b> field (this defaults in some cases) and click <b>Add</b>. This will set the browser to use compatibility mode for any page where the URL ends in that domain (in our example, clientspace.net).</p>

                <p><b>Problem</b>: You open Outlook and log into ClientSpace using the outlook add in, but when you attempt to Create a case or task you receive an error that simply says "null".</p>

                    <img src="../Resources/Images/Issues/OutlookNullError.png" />
                </p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Older versions of the Outlook Add-In allowed you to store an invalid URL configuration which contained a trailing slash (https://your.clientspace.net/).  This has been corrected with later versions of the application which strip the trailing slash from the URL on save.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: Remove the trailing slash from the URL by logging out and logging back in to the ClientSpace Outlook Add-In.** </p>
                <p>** A best practice would be to uninstall the Outlook Add-In and re-install it from the latest version that can be found in the Admin Workspace in ClientSpace.

                <p><b>Cause</b>: Conflicting outlook plugin is causing part of the process (normally the pop-ups for selecting a contact / confirmation message).</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>:</p>
                <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">In Outlook, go to <b>File</b> &gt; <b>Options</b> &gt; <b>Add-ins</b> &gt; <b>Manage COM Add-ins</b> and click <b>Go</b>.</p>

                <p><b>Cause</b>: Email Header information has been stripped off - likely by the Clients Network security.  The Outlook add-in reads the emails header information to determine if the email has links to an editable element in ClientSpace such as a task or case.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Problem</b>: Previously, when opening an email in Outlook, there was an option to edit the case. That option seems to be missing on some emails.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Firewall / Antivirus settings are stripping email header information.  The URL link used by the edit functionality is stored in the header information of the email itself.  Certain Firewall and / or antivirus/malware systems can strip this information from the email, removing the remote edit functionality in the Outlook Add-in.  Check this by opening the email in a separate window (pop-out in MS Outlook), then go to File Properties to see the Internet headers information.  If this is missing or has replaced by a message such as "Removed by Symantec Firewall", the ClientSpace domain needs to be authorized.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: Contact your Network security administrator about the problem.  They may be able to add the pertinent ClientSpace domain to your Network security unrestricted list, thereby allowing the header information from ClientSpace to remain on the emails.</p>

                <p><b>Cause</b>: Login credentials that are cached on the machine do not match the current username/password in ClientSpace.  This should be removed and reset with an Uninstall/Reinstall, but in some cases it does not.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Problem</b>: You run an Active Report which outputs to PDF, but when the report opens you find a page full of unreadable "garbage" characters instead of the report data.</p>
                <p class="ProcedureIntro">Issue 1</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: An unreadable or missing font has been used in the report that Adobe Acrobat is unable to process.  Acrobat provides you the ability to add fonts to the application from your local desktop. If these fonts aren't included in the report set, when the report tries to open the application cannot display the information and the data becomes garbled.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: Create a support ticket with <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.CompanyName" />. We may need to edit the Active report to use a more generic font and re-save the report.</p>
                <p class="ProcedureIntro">Issue 2</p>
                <p class="ProcedureIntro" style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Cause</b>: The Active Reports PDF print functionality does not react well when the ClientSpace web environment is extremely active while running large PDF reports.  A bad interaction between the Active Reports PDF distiller application and the ClientSpace Web Application pool can cause the PDF Distiller to generate these types of "Garbage" reports</p>
                <p class="ProcedureIntro" style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: Create a support ticket with <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.CompanyName" />. Recycling the Application pool on your site manually will often resolve these intermittent issues.</p>
                <p class="ProcedureIntro">Persistent PDF Issues</p>
                <p>On very rare occasions the number of users / report interactions on an install can cause the bad interaction between the PDF Distiller application and the ClientSpace Web application pool to occur frequently.  In these instances, it may be necessary to schedule a more frequent recycle of the ClientSpace application pool for your site.  Create a support ticket with <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.CompanyName" />. For assistance in determining if this additional step is necessary, log an Extranet case.</p>

                <p>**Current versions of the Outlook add-in resolve this issue by stripping the trailing slash from the URL when saving the login information.  A best practice would be to uninstall and re-install from the latest version on the Admin Workspace.</p>
