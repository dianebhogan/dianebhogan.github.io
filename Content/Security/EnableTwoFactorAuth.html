        <p>Enabling two-factor authentication for your ClientSpace installation redirects all your users to a login page for ClientSpace, regardless of their User Profile preference setting. If you have any questions about this or any other login function, log an Extranet case before making configuration changes.</p>
        <p><b>Two-factor authentication</b> (also known as 2FA ) is a method of confirming a user's claimed identity by using a combination of two different components. ClientSpace 2FA uses the standard username and password combination as the first factor, and a generated code sent to the user at authentication time as a second confirmation factor.</p>
        <p>For details on configuring your <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> authentication settings, see <MadCap:xref href="ConfigAuthSettings.html" title="Configuring authentication settings" alt="Configuring authentication settings">Configuring your [%=MyVariables.ProductName%] authentication settings</MadCap:xref>.</p>
