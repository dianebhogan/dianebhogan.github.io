        <h1>About <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /></h1>
        <p>ClientSpace is a world-class Enterprise CRM (customer relationship management) system that enables you to manage and measure client service across your entire organization. ClientSpace is a sophisticated application with many moving parts.</p>
        <p>In support of PEO clients, realizing your costs to support clients is a lot like putting together a puzzle upside down. While the definition of net client profit is not standard across the industry, ClientSpace provides an ideal platform to compare and measure how your clients stack up when it comes to boosting your bottom line.</p>
        <p>Additionally, users can access the system on any device, anywhere they can connect to the internet, all with a responsive design. The freedom of access opens up a world of possibilities when it comes to connecting with your clients.</p>
        <h2>Workflow Channels</h2>
        <p>If there is one thing that ClientSpace clients express as an objective for their implementation, it’s the orchestration of their workflow.  Workflow is one of those words that can mean different things to different people.  In the ClientSpace world, workflow means that ClientSpace can be configured to know how transactions flow through your business, know what validations and calculations need to happen as things move from one step to the next, and also which employees need to be involved at every step.</p>
        <h2>Email Templates</h2>
        <p>ClientSpace administrators can configure Email Templates to trigger based on specific conditions with message content (email or internal <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> message) appropriate for the trigger condition.</p>
        <h2>Dataforms</h2>
        <p>ClientSpace has been tailored to the unique needs of the PEO industry, primarily using the dataform architecture. Dataforms allow administrators to modify forms or create entirely new forms and sub-systems all without writing a line of code.</p>
        <h2>APIs and Integrations</h2>
        <p>One of the most powerful components of ClientSpace is the ability to import data into the system without any programming and without compromising the business rules and workflow that are critical to serving your clients.  </p>
        <h2>Reporting</h2>
        <p>ClientSpace reporting is powerful. It enables you to  produce reports, charts, visualizations, and dashboards using any of the data that is in the ClientSpace database.</p>
