                <MadCap:concept term="DocuSign" />In this step, you code your tags for DocuSign in the green Add section. The tags tell DocuSign what to read to determine if the field is a signature, a date, or a text field. These are the tags that you registered in your  merge template. Ensure that your merge template tags match the Signature Anchor (in the following procedure).</p>
            <p>You can also send a document with the requirement for In Person Signing, which is used when a valid DocuSign user acts as a signing host for a signer.  The document is sent to the signing host who physically delivers the document to the In Person Signer for signatures. For details on how to set this up, see <MadCap:xref href="DocuSign_InPerson.htm" title="Configuring DocuSign for in-person signing" alt="Configuring DocuSign for in-person signing">Configuring the email template for In Person Signing</MadCap:xref>.</p>

Let's say you have a \Name\ tag for the signee's name. Instead of creating separate \Name\-1, \Name\-2, \Name\-3 recipient entries,  create a single recipient entry with the tag of \Name\ and set the <span class="UXElement"># Tabs</span> to 3.

If you want to clone the tag and allow it to be used multiple times throughout the document, change the # Tabs to the number of potential tags you may have. Therefore, you only need to set this if you need multiples of the same. If you use # Tabs for Radio Buttons or Yes/No actions, it will fill all of those DocuSign tags the same way when the signer responds. For example, if there are three Tabs for Yes/No action and the signer responds Yes to one, it marks Yes to the remaining two as well  because the tags have the same label.</p>
