        <h1>Salesforce </h1>
        <p>The Salesforce API  is a PEO process that maintains data synchronization between a client’s <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> installation and their respective Salesforce system.&#160;</p>
        <p>During the life cycle of a Deal, either Salesforce or <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> is responsible for the data. Typically, when in the Lead Discovery cycle, Salesforce owns the data. As changes are made in Salesforce, <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> is updated with those changes. When the Deal has reached a certain level, <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> no longer accepts changes from Salesforce but keeps Salesforce up to date with certain data as changes are made in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />.&#160;</p>
        <p>Although this is a PEO process, custom fields in both <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> and Salesforce can be imported. The exchange of data between the systems is highly configurable. Data elements are mapped at the field level for each system using standard <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Import Map Headers and Details.&#160;</p>
        <p>When <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> dataforms (<strong>gen_</strong>) are updated from Salesforce, they are saved using Dataform Pipeline Logic, when executes business rules and triggers email templates.</p>
