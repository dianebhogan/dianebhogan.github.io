        <h1>ClientSpace data mapping for the PrismHR&#160;API</h1>
        <p>The PrismHR&#160;API provided  enables ClientSpace to connect to the PrismHR system remotely and exchange data. The attached spreadsheet (see at the end of this topic) provides some insight into the field mappings and how they are used in ClientSpace. </p>
        <p>Through the import process used by the API, the ClientSpace forms and fields are populated. Where you see PrismHR fields without a ClientSpace corollary, these are PrismHR API fields that are available, but not currently mapped in ClientSpace. We recommend reviewing the field mappings with Professional Services as the APIs continuously evolve. For assistance, please log an Extranet case.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">When some fields in ClientSpace are changed, the change can trigger business logic  that can affect pricing in the system as well as other workflows. If you are not sure of the effect of adding a field to an import, before making any changes, please log an Extranet case. </p>
