        <h1>Salesforce API v2.0</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the integration of Salesforce into ClientSpace using v2.0 of the API. The API requires immense precision to configure both Salesforce and ClientSpace including Connectivity configuration and Import mapping. Misconfiguring any of these settings can produce unexpected results and problematic consequences, such as duplicate records. Before you attempt to configure the Salesforce API integration, it is highly recommended that you log an Extranet case.</p>
