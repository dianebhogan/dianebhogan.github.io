        <h1>Slack integration</h1>
        <p>The Slack integration allows you to use slash commands in Slack to retrieve a high-level synopsis of Case and Task data with links to open these cases and tasks directly from Slack.  Integration with Slack requires configuring Slack as well as the <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> application.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">Required prerequisites </p>
        <p>Slack integration requires that you are already using Slack in your business and that you have a Slack Administrator.  Additionally, your Slack Administrator must configure the Slack Slash commands. For <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> clients, after the Slack Slash Command has been created,  log an Extranet case for help with configuring the Slack API.</p>
