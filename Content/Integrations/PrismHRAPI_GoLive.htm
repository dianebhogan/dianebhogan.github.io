        <h1>Before Go Live</h1>
        <p>When configured, a series of tests should be performed to compare the validity of the data retrieved by the API&#160;against existing data being imported into ClientSpace.&#160;This is crucial to ensure a smooth transition to API imports.&#160; </p>
        <p>These tests involve running the imports manually with the additional parameter of <strong>HRPRunImport=0</strong> to generate the files, but not import them. Then you should scrutinize the files for accuracy and completeness.&#160;</p>
        <p>Skipping the data validation testing can lead to duplicated or corrupted data, so it is critical to perform these validations before automating the API imports.&#160;If you need help with validation or have questions about this process, log an Extranet case.</p>
