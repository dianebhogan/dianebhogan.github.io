        <h1>Managing attachments</h1>
        <p>When managing attachments, you can upload new file versions and also change the primary file from within the version list. Files uploaded to ClientSpace as attachments or assigned to dataform fields can have a hierarchy of several files, all associated with a primary file. The primary file is considered the currently in-use file. Other files associated with the primary file are versions or versioned files. Versioned files can be updated to be the primary file (known as Pinning). This enables an historical record of file management activity.
A logical version number is displayed next to each file name. The number is derived from the order in which associated files were uploaded to the system, with v1 as the earliest.
</p>
        <p>On Attachment lists or Dataform Fields, only the primary file is displayed. Using  Upload File, you can manage versions. There is no technical limit to the number of files that can be included in the hierarchy, but only one file is designated as the primary file at any time. You can also browse the list of uploaded versions, pin them as the new current version, open the file, and removed the file.</p>
        <p><span class="UXElement">Protected versus unProtected</span>: If files are shared over multiple locations in ClientSpace, they can be managed as individual sets of files (Protected) or as a synchronized set (unProtected).  This implementation in ClientSpace is limited to Orgs, Contacts, and Activity attachments. For a description of this methodology, see <MadCap:xref href="FileVersion-Consider.htm" title="File version considerations for dataforms" alt="File version considerations for dataforms">File version considerations for dataforms</MadCap:xref>.</p>
