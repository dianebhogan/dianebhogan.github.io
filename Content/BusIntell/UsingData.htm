        <p>One of the most important parts of writing reports is to understand the data you’re building it with. Here is a high-level view of how the data is structured in client space:</p>

        <p class="ProcedureIntro">What data can you see?</p>
        <p>You will have access to a select number of custom views that have been developed for your use. To start out you’ll have access to the ClientSpace data.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">What is a view?</p>
        <p>A view is a specific grouping of data from tables in the database. These views have data grouped together that is related to each other to relieve you of the need to understand the data table relationships. We have included a number of views as part of our CORE and PEO packages for reporting use.</p>
