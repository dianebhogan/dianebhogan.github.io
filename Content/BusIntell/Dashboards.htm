        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1 ">Dashboards</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the creation and management of dashboard reports using the Business Intelligence module in <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />. This integrated application from Izenda automatically converts  any existing dashboards to the new dashboard format. While previous versions were limited to a static structure for the dashboard, tiles can now be resized. Users can also add new tiles to any point on the grid in the Dashboard Designer. The dashboard displays with more fluid animation as well. The Dashboard Designer/Viewer also includes a presentation mode, which allows the user to slide through dashboard tiles on a carousel.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Screen">The user guide for creating a new dashboard is available in PDF&#160;format. See <MadCap:xref href="../HOME/ViewPDFs.htm" title="view in PDF format" alt="view in PDF format" class="Heading">Viewing Help in PDF&#160;format</MadCap:xref>.</p>
