        <h1>Email add-in for Outlook</h1>
        <p>This topic provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the email add-in for Outlook for:</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Why use the email add-in?</h2>
        <p>The email add-in connects your Outlook email Inbox with <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> to automate the process of creating an activity record when you send an email. The add-in eliminates the need to maintain activity records in multiple places. When you send an email from <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />, the activity is captured for the client, prospective client, or lead. Additionally, the email add-in enables an easy way to create activities, cases, and tasks from received emails listed in the External Mailbox dashboard. All activity is performed from within <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />.</p>
