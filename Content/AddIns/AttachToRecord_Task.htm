        <h1>Attaching emails to Tasks</h1>
        <p>With Attach To Record, you can attach emails to a task in a prospect or client workspace.  Attaching emails to a task is beneficial to organizations that are task-centric versus case-centric. </p>
        <p><b>Scenario</b>: An underwriting user receives an email from the Workers Comp insurer regarding a current task they are working on. The user wants to attach the email to a task, to maintain an accurate history.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To attach the message to a dataform:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>Post To ClientSpace</b> page, under <b>Links</b>, select <b>Attach To Record</b>.<br />The Select Record form opens in the right pane.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Complete the form:</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>If the FROM address is the same as the ClientSpace email address, it is not used to determine the Workspace. Instead, the first TO address is used to determine the Workspace.</li>
                            <li>If the FROM address is DIFFERENT from the ClientSpace email address, the Workspace defaults to the Workspace of the email sender (the FROM address).</li>
                            <li>The email address is compared to all employee email addresses (both Personal and Work email) in the system and tries to match the email. If a match is found, the Workspace associated with that employee is used. If multiple instances of the employee email (Personal and Work) exist, the most recently changed instance is used. If the From email is not recognized, then you can select a Workspace of your choice.</li>
