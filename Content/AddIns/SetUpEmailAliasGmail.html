        <h1>Setting up an email alias on Gmail
        </h1>
        <p>One way to maximize the mileage of the <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Email Integration is through aliases to create specific case types or create cases in a specific workspace.&#160;For this to work, however, you must first have a unique email address to which&#160;mail will be sent. For Gmail, this is accomplished using custom tags appended to your Gmail user account.</p>
        <p>Gmail does not offer traditional aliases, but you can receive messages sent to <strong><a href="mailto:your.username+any.alias@gmail.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">your.username+any.alias@gmail.com</a></strong>. For example, messages sent to <strong><a href="mailto:jane.doe+notes@gmail.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">jane.doe+payroll@gmail.com</a></strong> are delivered to <strong><a href="mailto:jane.doe@gmail.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">jane.doe@gmail.com</a></strong>.</p>
        <p>You can also&#160;set up filters in Gmail to automatically direct these messages to <strong>Trash</strong>, apply a label or star, skip the inbox, or forward to another email account.</p>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" />, you can then use this aliased email address to create custom API Configurations, Email Integrations, and Email Templates&#160;that can then be used to either create a specific type of Client Service case, generate the case in a specific workspace or both, as well as send customized responses back to whoever logged the request. In the example, your email template response could&#160;begin "Thank you for logging a Payroll Case with BigPEO. Your payroll representative has been alerted and someone will be contacting you shortly to help you resolve your issue."</p>
