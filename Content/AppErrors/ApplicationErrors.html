            <MadCap:dropDownHead class="ErrMsg">
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>"Invalid Cast Exception" when using Business Intelligence</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Problem</b>: You run a report that has an embedded drill down link and when you click the link an error is thrown: "Invalid cast exception - an error has occurred while processing this request".  </p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Column additions in the middle of the report have caused the drill down link to break as the referenced column has been moved.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Adding a column to the middle of a report with drill downs will shift the column count below the new column by one.  This can be corrected by either:
</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">
Move the new column to the end of the report.</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">
Update your embedded drill down links to account for the new column.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Problem</b>: You attempt to access the ClientSpace pricing console and you receive the error "You are not authorized to view this page".</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: You do not have sufficient security rights to add/edit one of the Pricing Console associated functions or dataforms (Client Master, Pricing Batch, State or Code). </p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: Update the Role security to include appropriate rights to View/Add/Edit the forms using the following steps. There are several security entities in use by the Pricing Console.  The most common are:</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">CRM - creating and managing Organizations - At least View rights</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">biz_workflow_cm_create_batch - creating batches from the Client Master  - At least Add Rights to create new batch</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">PricingConsole - access to the pricing console - At least View rights</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">QuickEdit - At least <b>Add</b> rights</p>
                <p class="Bullet2" MadCap:autonum="• ">QuickEdit_subfields - for each field on the Quick Edit form there are available view/Add/Edit rights, these will need to be set for each field (if editing of pricing rows is allowed)</p>
                <p>At least <b>View</b> rights are also required for the related Dataform entities such as:</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">gen_PricingBatch</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">gen_Pricing</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">gen_PricingBatchState</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">gen_PricingCompCode</p>
                <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">gen_ClientMaster</p>
                <p>If any of the dataforms are secured the user will need to be in a role with appropriate rights for the dataform, such as Add or Edit rights.</p>

                <p><b>Problem</b>: You attempt to open the pricing console and receive SQL errors relating to Arithmetic Overflow.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Field value is not properly set or way outside normal parameters.  Something such as the Admin % field being set to 150000%.  Downstream calculations that use this number will fail.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Fix erroneous data</p>
                <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Find the erroneous field on one of the Pricing Forms - either Batch, State, or Code.</p>
                <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Because you cannot access these forms through the Pricing Console, you need to go to the Workspace in question and Access Dataforms from the Workspace Action Menu.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Problem</b>: You attempt to add a new field to a dataform and receive the error "Whoops - something went wrong..."  When you check the exception logs you find the slightly more detailed error:  "Object reference not set to an instance of an object. URL: http://yourinstall.clientspace.net/Next/Admin<br />/ProjectAttribute/Detail" the system will not allow you to save the field.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: You have attempted to use a field name that is already in use on the dataform. This could be a system generated field, such as CreateDate, UpdateDate, CreatedByUserID, UpdatedByUserID, etc. SQL will not allow you to create two columns on the same table with exactly the same name, hence the error.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Change the field name and re-save. Avoid using any of the names for the existing fields on the dataform, or any of the system protected fields. If you are unsure of the preexisting field names, you should run the Dataform Specification report to get a list of all the current dataform field names.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Problem</b>: When trying to edit the Field configuration on a dataform, the following error appears:</p>
                <p class="Code">Incorrect syntax near ','.</p>
                <p class="Code">Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'with'. If this statement is a common table expression, an xmlnamespaces clause or a change tracking context clause, the previous statement must be terminated with a semicolon.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>:  A lookup field does not have a Lookup Group defined and is being set as a Multiform Column.  The lookup group is used to decode the column for the list, so the system effectively doesn't know how to decode the column.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Open the Lookup field that is defined as a Multiform Column and add a Lookup Group. See <MadCap:xref class="Heading" href="../Admin_Config/Lookups.html">Adding or configuring lookups</MadCap:xref>.

When you check the exception logs, you find the error: "Rebuild failed: trailer not found.; Original message: Error reading string at file pointer #######"</p>

Go to the Dataform Admin section under System Admin to set up column headers.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Multiform list has not been defined.</p>

                <p><b>Problem</b>: You are attempting to edit a dashboard embedded Report Title or Description and you receive the error "Error  Failed to save dashboard: CategoryName\DashboardName"</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Neither the Title nor description on Reports from the dashboard UI accepts special characters, including numeric characters such as <i>equals</i> signs.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Change your Description or title so that it does not contain a special character.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><b>Problem</b>: When trying to run a merge, the error message, “The OpenDataSource Method or property is not available because this command is not available for reading” appears.  The merge document opens, however, it returns no data.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: Microsoft Word 2013 defaults to open a document in read only mode.  The data cannot be written into the merge because Word does not allow editing in read only mode.</p>
                <p><b>Solution</b>: Change default settings in Word.</p>
                <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Open a Word document.</p>

                <p><b>Cause</b>: Link Display condition is configured with SQL Protected Word.  The underlying code has been designed to eliminate the possibility of SQL Injection, and so will throw an error if any of the words DELETE, SELECT, DROP, UPDATE, EXEC, EXECUTE, INSERT, ALTER or CREATE are used when configuring Link Condition Expressions.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: Edit the Link Display Configuration conditions to remove the SQL Protected word. Also remove the Protected word from the Condition Expression line so it matches the Display Configuration labels.</p>
                <p>Both the Label and the Condition expression should avoid using the word SELECT.</p>

Contact the system administrator to request a change to the accepted file types or zip the file before uploading." (replacing .XXXX with the invalid file extension).</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: The File type you are attempting to upload has not been added to the list of Valid File Attachment Extensions. For example, the system allows .jpg files, but not .jpeg files.</p>

                <p><b>Cause</b>: Improper Source File configuration on the import config that conflicts with an existing import. For example, creating an import config with a source file of EmployeeConversion*.csv when an employee*.csv import already exists.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>:                         Alter the Source File name in the Import Configuration to make it unique. Alter the name of the file being uploaded to match the new Source File value.</p>

                <p><b>Cause</b>: The Comp Claim system in ClientSpace validates the information necessary to complete claim logging. One of these data items is the associated Workers' Comp Policy.  The rule called by the comp policy import preprocess is HE_VerifyCompPolicyIsLocated. If you do not enable this rule on the Imports pipeline, the system allows the comp claim dataform save to happen without a verified fkAdminWorkersCompPolicyID. Subsequently the foreign key relationship that is expected later in the save process does not exist.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: If you are importing claim information you must enable the HE_VerifyCompPolicyIsLocated rule on the Imports pipeline.  This unfortunately causes imported records without a valid fkAdminWorkersCompPolicyID to fail.</p>

If the error persists, please contact the system administrator."  Checking the Exception logs under Admin Settings may reveal some form of Mathematical overrun error.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: On open, the pricing console recalculates pricing, using the values stored on the Pricing Batch, Pricing State, and Pricing Codes dataforms, as well as defaults stored in various places throughout the system  The most common issue responsible for this type of issue is bad data on one of the pricing dataforms, causing the pricing calculations to far exceed the limits of the fields in which the calculated values will be stored. Accidentally typing a large number of Employees on a pricing code form, or an extremely large percentage on a pricing modifier field will cause the type of mathematical overrun error in question.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: Correct the bad data using the following steps:</p>

                <p><b>Problem</b>: You are editing an existing dataform field that uses the decimal or percent datatype and you attempt to alter the mask value.  Upon save you receive a message stating: "New mask conflicts with existing data. Contact the system administrator for further assistance."  The record will not save.</p>
                <p><b>Cause</b>: The system allows the precision (numbers to the right of the decimal) of a  mask to be changed when data has been saved into a decimal or percentage field, but the numbers to the left of the decimal point cannot be altered without significantly changing the value of the data stored in the field.  For this reason, these types of changes are not allowed.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Solution</b>: To adjust a decimal or percent field to alter the values left of the decimal, you must delete the field and recreate it on the form.  Doing so deletes all the data stored within the field, so this action should not be undertaken lightly.  If you have questions about the effects of deleting a field on your data or need assistance creating a solution, log an Extranet case.</p>
