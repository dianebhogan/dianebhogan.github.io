        <h1>Configuring scheduled workflows</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Workflow Channels" />Business processes can sometimes be triggered upon reaching a specific date, such as a task that needs to be completed two weeks prior to a client's first payroll date. Workflow channels allow you to configure these types of automatic business processes using scheduled workflows.&#160; This topic provides a high-level overview of scheduled workflows as well as step-by-step instructions that can help you to begin using this robust feature to schedule the creation of workflow generated tasks and cloned dataforms.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To configure scheduled workflows:
        </p>
        <p class="L1Num1" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Go to <strong>System Admin</strong> <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_SysAdmin.png" /> &gt; <strong>Workflow Channels</strong>.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The Workflow Channels dashboard opens.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Click <strong>Add</strong>.<br /></p>
        <p class="StepResult">The Choose Workflow Triggering Type dialog opens with options to select <b>Real Time</b> or <b>Scheduled</b>.</p>
        <p class="L1Num" MadCap:autonum="3. ">When you select <strong>Scheduled</strong>, the Add Workflow Channel wizard opens with Step 1 Channel.&#160;In this step, you need to configure the date that triggers the scheduled Workflow Action.</p>

">After your configured workflow is saved, these conditions are evaluated by a scheduled process (<strong>Generate Scheduled Workflows</strong>) to determine if the date field combined with the other workflow schedule options&#160;as well as any additional Conditions added in Step 4 (Conditions) are met.&#160;</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Because these workflow triggers are scheduled, the real time field analysis to determine if a field has changed (IsDirty) cannot happen.&#160;Because of this, notice that the IsDirty qualifier is not available when adding additional triggering conditions to scheduled tasks.</p>
        <p>If all the triggering conditions are met, the dataform or task is generated from the Workflow.&#160;These actions can then trigger other dependent workflow items (such as a second task spawned when the scheduled task is complete) or completely new workflow channels.&#160;In this way, scheduled workflows can  drive your business processes based on milestone triggering dates stored in your system.<br /></p>
