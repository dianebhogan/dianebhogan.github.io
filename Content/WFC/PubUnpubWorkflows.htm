        <h1>Publishing and unpublishing workflows</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Workflow Channels" />When you return to the Workflow Channel search list, you can publish and unpublish items. The Workflow Channels list displays published Workflow Channels by default when opened initially.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you can publish and unpublish sections of a workflow within a channel. You can publish and unpublish Workflow Channel items individually so that you can set up complex workflows without keeping the entire channel in the same published/unpublished state. Changing the publish/unpublish state for a workflow item does not affect any dependent workflow items. The dependent workflow items remain in their respective state. If the parent item of a child is unpublished, a warning message is issued.
