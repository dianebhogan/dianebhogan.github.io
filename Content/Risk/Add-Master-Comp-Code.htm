        <h1>Adding Master Comp Codes</h1>
        <p>Workers’ Compensation Class Codes or Comp Codes denote the risk associated with an employment type and a dollar value to that risk from a pricing perspective. In most states, the classification system is devised and maintained by NCCI, the National Council on Compensation Insurance. NCCI is an independent advisory organization primarily funded by the insurance companies that utilize their statistical data for rating. NCCI develops and provides data for setting manual rates (by state) for workers’ compensation pricing and assigning an employer’s annual experience modification rate based on a ratio of claims frequency and cost of premium paid.</p>
        <p>A basic classification code denotes a particular type of job duty within a business. Therefore, according to specific criteria, a class code is the systematic arranging of properties, persons, or business operations into groups or categories. This arrangement is the basis for determining rates and avoiding unfair discrimination by insurance companies. A Scopes class code is the identifying number for each occupational classification. It’s a three- or four-digit numeric code assigned to a specific occupation. The code is based on the nature of the work for the employer and employee. It is common for most employers to have two or more class codes on their policy. For example, class code 8810 is for a clerical exposure, and class code 5645 is for a general residential construction exposure. A contractor might have laborers working under class code 5645 and an office person rated under the clerical code 8810.  Generally, the higher the risk associated with the code, the more expensive the rate.</p>
