        <p>The Org Other Info record appears as a tab on the Organization Detail, but it is, in fact, a configurable dataform tied to Organization records. As a dataform, you can customize the Organization record to store information that is important to your business and sales process. The Organization Other Info tab also supports configurable business rules, field display conditions, and links.&#160;How your company uses Org Other Info depends in part on your sales prospecting process. A few examples of this form&#160;are included in this topic.</p>
        <h2>Carrier Details and NAIC&#160;number</h2>
        <p>On the <b>Home</b> tab, in the <b>Primary Information</b> fieldset, when you select <b>Carrier</b> for <b>Category</b>,  in the Other Info tab, the Carrier Details fieldset becomes available with the <b>NAIC</b> field. </p>

        <p>The NAIC number is assigned to each individual underwriting company. The NAIC&#160;field auto-fills from the carrier's <b>Org.IndustryCode</b> field.</p>
