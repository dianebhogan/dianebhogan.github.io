        <p>The Action Center is a menu, displayed in a panel that is adjacent to the Organization record, The Action Center comprises the following mini-panels that expand and collapse:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><b>Workflow</b> links allow you to advance the Organization through the workflow processes such as Create Client. We discuss the Workflow links later in the onboarding process.</li>
            <li><b>Contacts</b> panel is where you add the people with whom you will work during the onboarding process to service them as a client. </li>
            <li><b>Activities</b> reflect your communication with the prospect: Emails, Phone Calls, Follow Ups, and Notes.</li>
            <li><b>Appointments</b> panel is where you record meetings with the prospect to include information such as date, time, type, status, and location. Appointments are events that you can add to your calendar using the Action Center from the open Organization record. Additionally, you can schedule appointments with clients from the Action Center and your ClientSpace calendar. Adding appointments from the Action Center saves you time by creating the event on your calendar and recording the event with the Organization. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="ClientSpace.Screen">See <MadCap:xref href="../Manage/Appointments.htm" title="Appointments" alt="Appointments">Appointments</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li><b>Tasks</b> are how you track individual actions that need to be completed to close the sale. Tasks are configurable assignment items with an Owner and Assigned To person and have defined start and optional end dates.</li>
            <li><b>Attachments</b> allow you to attach files to the Organization record such as communication in other formats.</li>
            <li><b>Security</b> shows users and roles who have access to the Organization record. From this mini-panel, you can administer access by adding or removing roles and controlling access: View, Edit, and View List.</li>
        </ul>
