            <MadCap:concept term="Sales" />Sales and prospecting with <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /></h1>
        <p>The very essence of <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> is client data. To track client data, you need to find the prospects, sell them on the services you provide, and get a signed contract. </p>
        <p>Common terminology for the sales module includes <i>lead</i>, <i>prospect</i>, <i>client</i>, and <i>implementation:</i></p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">A <b>lead</b> is a sales target that has not yet shown any reasonable expectation of buying.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">A <b>prospect</b> is a sales target that has shown potential intent to buy or is actively considering a purchase.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">A <b>client</b> is a company that has committed to purchase.</p>
        <p class="Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">The <b>implementation</b> is the unique set of business processes required to bring on a new client.</p>
        <p>The following diagram illustrates the sales data flow.</p>
