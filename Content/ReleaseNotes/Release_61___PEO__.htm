                        <hr />
                        <p>A new field has been added to the User Other Info tab called <strong>"Immediate Supervisor"</strong> - This is a User datatype.</p>
                        <p>The Case escalation process has been enhanced to include <strong>"Next Priority"</strong>, <strong>"Next Assigned to User"</strong> and <strong>"Escalation Notification Recipient" </strong>(includes "Immediate Supervisor").&#160; When a case with a matching priority and an Escalation Time value less than or equal to now the case will be escalated, Setting the Priority to "Next Priority", the Asssigned To User to "Next Assigned To User" and notifying the "Escalation Notification Recipient"&#160;</p>
                        <p>These escalations can then be cascaded - Low to Medium, then Medium to High and so on changing the escalation hours, assigned to or notification recipient as required.&#160; For help configuring case escalations, contact your account manager.</p>
                        <p>The following system changes have been completed for this development:</p>
                        <p>New fields have been added&#160;to the Case Type Escalation <br />&#160; &#160;• Next Priority (Lookup)<br />&#160; &#160;• Next Assigned To User (User filtered by Role, PEO Employee role)<br />&#160; &#160;• Send Escalation Email (checkbox)<br />&#160; &#160;• Escalation Notification Recipient (Lookup)<br />&#160; &#160;• Role<br />&#160; &#160;• Department Manager<br />&#160; &#160;• Immediate Supervisor<br />&#160; &#160;• Escalation Email Role (role selector)</p>
                        <p>Field Display Rules were added:<br />&#160; • When "Send Escalation Email" = True Then enable "Escalation Notification Recipient" <br />&#160; • When "Escalation Notification Recipient" = RoleThen enable "Escalation Email Role"</p>
                        <p>&#160; • Added a&#160;new field to User Other Info tab called "Immediate Supervisor" - User selector datatype.</p>
                        <p>&#160; • Added metadata to Case Status for "Exclude from Escalation"</p>
                        <p>&#160; • Created a&#160;new Schedule Process called Process Case Escalations.<br />&#160; • When this process runs, it checks the Case Escalation 1 fields to determine if the case should be escalated, if so, then it&#160;checks for the "Exclude from Escalation" flag, Next Priority, Next Assigned To User, and the Send Escalation Email flag. <br />&#160; • If "Exclude from Escalation" is checked, then end, if unchecked&#160;we proceed to the next step.<br />&#160; • If Next Priority is set, then change the Case Priority. This triggers a&#160;business rule to reset escalation fields.<br />&#160; • If Next Assigned To User is set, the system&#160;changes the Case Assigned To User.<br />&#160; • If Send Escalation Email flag is checked the system then sends a new Case Escalation email. This email should use Email Templates with the same Field Replace&#160;logic as the existing case notification email template.</p>
                        <p>&#160; • A new business rule has been added to the Client Service Case that will recalculate the Case Escalation fields any time the Case Priority changed.</p>

                        <p>The Company initial import has been enhanced to now create legal entity records in the Admin workspace for PrismHR clients where the associated Legal Entity does not already exist in ClientSpace.&#160; Previously these records would be skipped with the error "A matching legal entity record cannot be found for client XXXXX"</p>
                        <p>This process creates a very basic record, it is recommended that a&#160;ClientSpace Admin update this record with data from PrismHR as soon as possible after the stub record is generated.&#160; For Non-PEO clients if a matching record is not found the system will create a "GENERIC ASO" legal entity.&#160; This will be used by all subsequent non-PEO clients where a matching legal entity cannot be found.</p>
