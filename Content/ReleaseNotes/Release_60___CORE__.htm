                        <hr />
                        <p>Resolved an issue which occurred because of the way the field display code was relying on the field labels to find required fields, the recent change to add the help icon to the field labels caused this to break.&#160;&#160;The field display code was changed&#160;to not rely on the labels, but to use an attribute, directly on the fields, instead.</p>

                        <p>Changes were made to standardize the way that Right Menu file security works across entities in the system. Previously the dataform file right Action item menu was wide open, so if you have view rights to the dataform you can add, edit and delete files, but, on orgs, contacts, activities and tasks, you&#160;needed at least&#160;edit rights to the entity in order to add, edit or delete files. All entities now work like this:<br />* First, you&#160;must have edit rights for the entity that you're on in order to do anything but view files.<br />* If you have edit rights, then you can optionally lock files down using an "_$Attachment" security entity.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dataforms use {TableName}_$Attachment - set by checking the&#160;"Attachments Secured" box on Dataform properties</li>
                            <li>Orgs, contacts, activties will use CRM_$Attachment - must be added by a ClientSpace representative - if you would like to utilize CRM attachment security contact your Account manger.</li>
                            <li>Tasks will use Incident_$Attachment&#160;- must be added by a ClientSpace representative - if you would like to utilize Task attachment security contact your Account manger.</li>

                        <p>In our ongoing efforts to improve system performance and the user experience we have added several additional indexes to commonly used dataform tables to speed data access, including such dataforms as the Client Master and Policy Comp Codes.</p>
