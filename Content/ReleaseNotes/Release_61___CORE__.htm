                                <p>The "DocuSign Get Docs Status" scheduled process has been updated so that if you are using the Attachments feature to include additional documents (multiples) in an envelope, it will place the documents back in the field from which they came when the process is completed.</p>
                                <p>We would previously download these documents out of DocuSign (when envelop status is completed) as a single document but it is possible to pull them back out as separate documents. When we do this we place the completed doc in the field it was retrieved from. This allows users to use the _GenerateMergeFile business rule (see above) to run a merge and deposit in a field, then have a chance to review the document before send to DocuSign for signature. Then once completed and retrieved the documents would go back where they were pulled from.</p>
                                <p>This process runs business logic on the destination dataforms and also uses file versioning if enabled for that site. The downloaded doc is pinnned as a new version.</p>

                                <p>DocuSign allows you to include a parameter on each Recipient/Tab in the envelop called "Ignore If Not Present".&#160;&#160; The DocuSign integration has been enhanced&#160;enabling you to define and include a recipient and associated tags in the envelope but not throw an error if that tags is not found in the envelope's documents using the "Ignore If Not Present" checkbox on the recipient configuration.&#160; This makes tags "optional" as the system allows the send to DocuSign with or without tags marked in this way.</p>

                                <p>A "# Tags Needed" integer field was added to the email recipient dialog so that if the "Ignore If Not Present" box it checked, it will clone that Recipient &amp; Tab for how ever many Tags are needed, appending "-1", "-2", and so on to the end of the tag. This enables us to have a dynamic number of Tags generated by the merge SQL and placed into the document while only having to setup one Recipient record on the email template.&#160; Let's say you have a /Name/ tag for the signees name - Instead of creating separate /Name/-1, /Name/-2, /Name/-3 recipient entries you would create a single recipient entry with the tag of /Name/ and set the "# of Tabs Needed" to 3.&#160; It is a best practice to check the "Ignore if not present" checkbox otherwise Docusign will reject the document if all tabs are not present.</p>

                                <p>Resolved 2 grid column hiding issues -</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Problem with the resize threshold that forced columns to hide too quickly, especially on mobile devices</li>
                                    <li>Problem with grid refresh which would reset the grid to defaults after editing a list record.&#160; Custom column selection and re-sizing would get reset if you edited a record.&#160;</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Thresholds have been adjusted to be less likely to hide columns and the grid will retain custom configuration after editing list items.</p>
