                        <p>The policy selector on the Certificate of Insurance has been updated to match the functionality of other areas in the system which currently use the "~".</p>

                            <li>The tilde ("~") may be used to include inactive policies - so if the user types “~A”, the drop down would show active &amp; inactive policies where the policy title starts with the letter A.</li>

                        <p>The list for active records will display “Policy Title – Eff Date (Policy#)”. <br />The list for inactive records will display “Policy Title – Eff Date (Policy#) (inactive)”.</p>

                        <p>The Workers' Comp Claim deletion function has been updated to include all dataforms with a direct foreign key relationship to the comp claim, including such records as Financials and Claim Deductible Bill records.

                        <p>Corrected an issue in the Pricing Matrix Widget controller where the "use custom pricing and client code" properties were not being populated. This would happen only when the matrix was opened from the pricing console.</p>

                        <p>Fixed a bug that was causing the Org Primary Project to not be set during imports. The effect of this was that Contact matching in email integration was not working as it should, and generated cases would be attached to the default workspace for the affected Organization records.</p>
