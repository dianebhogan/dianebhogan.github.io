                        <p>Resolved an issue in the Case Type Subscriptions module that allowed Global Administrators to erroneously assign case type subscriptions to users in Workspaces to which they had no access. The system now filters the list of available workspaces by the selected user when creating case type subscriptions.</p>

                        <p>The business rule which expires offered benefits plans has been enhanced. Upon plan expiration the rule now appends "<strong>-Exp (####)</strong>" with #### being the year the offered plan was expired. This allows for re-use of a Client Plan Code. Previously if a Client plan code from an expired plan was re-used the system would throw a Duplicate CPC Hard error and not allow the new offered plan to be saved until the expired plan CPC had been changed.</p>
