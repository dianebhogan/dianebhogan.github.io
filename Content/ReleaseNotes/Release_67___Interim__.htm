                        <p>The Contact Management system has been enhanced to allow Contact users to be created from a template.&#160; When the "Create User" checkbox on the contact is checked and the contact record is saved, the system will generate a user record using contact information such as First Name, Last Name, Phone email and associated Organization and combine this with user profile settings from a pre-designated Contact User Template.&#160; The fields which are cloned from the template user include:</p>

                        <p>A&#160;new Application Variable has been created - &#160;'app-i-contact-templateuser' which specifies the UserID of a Template User to be used when generating the contact user records.</p>
                        <p>Caveats to this</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Resolved the following issues found while testing other items:</p>
                        <p><strong>Dataform Page display issue if field placed in Position zero:</strong>
                            <br />&#160; If you added a field to a dataform configuration and select Row 0 as it's position (cols 1 or 2) The field was not displayed on the page and the admin fieldset moved from the bottom to the top of the page.&#160; This issue has been resolved, allowing you to position fields without issue.</p>
                        <p><strong>Log Datatype and Field display:</strong>
                            <br />Resolved an issue where if a Log field was contained in a fieldset marked as read-only &#160;through Field display conditions when&#160;the system enabled the fieldset it would also enables the log field for editing&#160;(it would still appear read-only but if you clicked into the field you were able to type into it and&#160;using Save or Apply at that point would save the text into the database without adding the log time date stamp, as if you were using a Text Area instead of a Log datatype).</p>

                        <p>Resolved an issue in the system List Manager where checkbox filter parameters added to a search would not be cleared when using the "Clear" or "Reset" buttons to eliminate added filters.</p>
                        <p>Lists will now respect the Clear and Reset buttons for all filter types, including checkboxes. The only exception to this being if the list has a required field filter.</p>

                        <p>Resolved an issue on the time tracker module which allowed users to create records that were not tied to a specific record type and record. These records would then be deleted by the Time tracker cleanup scheduled process (Delete Orphaned Time Records) The system now requires the Record Type and Record be selected before saving when created from the time tracker module, these fields are automatically filled when created from a dataform.</p>

                        <p>Upon resize in Widget Layout, normal scroll behavior was picked up on the core widgets but not on the Watch Widget causing scrolling issues in the widget. This has been corrected allowing the Watch Widget to act like other widgets</p>

                        <p>In the Workspace environment, the Followup Widget displays a grid of follow up activities. The first column of each row has a link to the specific activity that is being followed. That link previously was unresponsive. Two other fields within the row also have link (to org and to contact) but they worked as expected. Resolved the issue with the Widget so that the jump link now will open the appropriate record.</p>
