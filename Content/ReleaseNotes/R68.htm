                        <p class="TableTextLeft">Tasks within the application have been enhanced to make them more organized and easier to use.&#160; These changes include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All of the task detail fields have been organized into a "General" fieldset.</li>

                            <li>An "Administrative Fields" fieldset has been added below the "General" fieldset - similar to the Administrative fieldset on dataforms. It will include all of the same fields as dataforms, excluding Import ID and Workspace but adding the "Date Updated" and "Updated By".&#160; Only global admins can see this fieldset.</li>
                            <li>The Task "Archive" checkbox has been updated to use the "Is Active" format, like dataforms, and most everywhere else in the application. This checkbox has been moved out of the fieldset area, to the bottom left of the form, with the label "Is Active". This is a cosmetic change to make the task functionality consistent with the rest of the application - the underlying data structure is being preserved so as to not affect existing reports which rely on the "Archive" flag.&#160;All existing logic that Archives a task when completed has also been preserved.</li>

A scheduled process (Generate Scheduled Workflow) compares the current date to the triggering date field of each scheduled workflow as well as any additional&#160;triggering conditions to determine whether the task or dataform will be cloned. The triggering determination can be modified using a date offset and supports a Grace period should all the triggering conditions not be immediately met.&#160; </p>

                        <p class="TableTextLeft">Workflow channels have been enhanced to separate the workflow channel from all of the workflow items, allowing for true concurrent workflow items to be generated from the initial triggering event. Previously an initial task would need to be attached to the triggering event and all dependent items would be fired from the triggering task. By separating the workflow channel from the workflow items the system can now generate multiple independent workflows simultaneously from the same triggering event. Workflow tasks can then spawn dependent workflow items allowing you to create cascading workflow events. Each of the triggered workflow items share a triggering Form, but can have unique triggering fields and events, providing for much more robust configurations.</p>

You can now select user fields on a system dataform containing a user type field when configuring workflow notifications by selecting the option "From a field on Form". This displays a list of forms within the system which contain user fields. Once a form is selected a list of user type field on the form is available for selection. When notification occurs the email address for the user in this field will be looked up and a notification sent.</p>
