During the sequence of running, the API records would get processed out of order. The system would try to match the client but not find the Client Number so the workspace was skipped and the system would then uncheck the Sync with PrismHR checkbox on the Client Master. Since the box was unchecked, when the workspace was processed for the second configuration it would not synchronize. The issue has been corrected.</td>
