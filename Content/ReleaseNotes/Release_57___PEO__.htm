                        <p>In High Deductible policies the funding rate is usually determined by starting with a flat percentage of Manual Rate. This is known as a High Deductible Liability Factor. This factor would be used in lieu of Increased Limits, Experience Modifier, and Scheduled Credit that are used to develop the Standard Premium. However, the Standard Premium is still is needed since it is used as the basis for other assessments which are then added to the High Deductible Liability Premium. High Deductible Liability Factor has been added on the Workers' Comp Policy. This change only affects the cost side of the equation.</p>
                        <p>A new Yes/No field called "High Deductible Policy" has been added in the existing cost factors fieldset. If "Use Cost Factors to Calculate Funding Rate" is set to "Yes", then this new field will be enabled.</p>
                        <p>A new percentage field (4 decimals) called "High Deductible Liability Factor (%)" has also been added. This field is enabled if the "High Deductible Policy" field is set to "Yes".</p>
                        <p>These new fields are cloned when a policy is renewed/cloned.</p>
                        <p>The funding rate calculation logic has been adjusted to use the new High Deductible factor. This change affects the cost side of the equation only, thus affecting the pricing console profit calculation whether it be a Master or MCP policy.</p>
