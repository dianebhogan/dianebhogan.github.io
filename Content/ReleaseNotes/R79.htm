        <p class="SubHdr">Workspace search (Case 30068)&#160;</p>
        <p>Workspace search functionality has been enhanced to improve the user experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When adding records outside of a workspace, such as from a dashboard, Template workspaces are removed from the workspace selector.</li>
            <li>When adding a dataform from a dashboard, only workspaces that include that dataform are listed (this includes the recent workspaces and workspace typeahead).</li>
            <li>When adding a non-dataform from a dashboard (e.g., calendar), all available workspaces are listed. Template workspaces are never listed (Project.Template = 1).</li>
            <li>The <strong>Recent Workspaces</strong> list now has additional filters for excluding Template workspaces and excluding workspaces that do not have access to the ProjectType being added (if it is not a dataform, that filter is removed).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SubHdr">Email templates: Attachments (Case 30463)&#160;</p>
        <p>The email template system has been enhanced to add email attachments.&#160;The System Admin can configure an email template to include a static attachment along with an Email Template.</p>
        <p>When&#160;you initially save&#160;a new&#160;Email Template, the Attachment panel displays in the Action Center. The recipient of the Email generated by the Template receives any attachments added to the Attachment panel when the template is triggered.&#160;The&#160;Descriptive text on&#160;<strong>Step 5: Attachments</strong>&#160;includes a sentence indicating that&#160;after saving the Email Template, the Attachments panel displays so static attachments can be included.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Workflow Channels: Improved experience (Case 33340)&#160;<img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_FunctionalChange.png" title="Change in functionality" alt="Change in functionality" /></p>
        <p>Workflow channels have been enhanced to improve the user experience when creating or editing a workflow channel item.&#160;Previously, when you clicked <strong>Finish</strong> at the end of the workflow channel wizard, the record would save and return the admin user to the channel as if nothing had happened. You would then use <strong>Cancel</strong> to exit the workflow creation process.&#160;</p>
        <p>The system has been augmented with a&#160;more elegant finishing process.&#160;When&#160;the system admin&#160;gets to the end of the initial item of a Workflow Channel, now there are buttons for&#160;<strong>Back</strong>,&#160;<strong>Continue</strong>,and&#160;<strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <strong>Back</strong> to return to the previous step of the Workflow Item.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Continue</strong> for a prompt stating "This Workflow Channel is unpublished. Would you like to publish?" with an option for Yes and No.&#160;Either selection takes you to the first step of a dependent Workflow Item.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong> for a prompt stating "This Workflow Channel is unpublished. Would you like to publish?" with an option for <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>No</strong>.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yes</strong> returns you to the Workflow Channel search with the new Workflow Channel in a published state.&#160;</li>
                <li><strong>No</strong> returns you to the Workflow Channel search with the new Workflow Channel in an unpublished state.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When you reach the end of a dependent item in a Workflow Channel, you can now click&#160;<strong>Back</strong>, <strong>Continue</strong>, or&#160;<strong>Finish</strong>.&#160;<ul><li><strong>Back</strong> or <strong>Continue</strong> behavior mirrors the previously stated behavior.</li><li><strong>Finish</strong> returns you to the Workflow Channel Detail page (the one with the Item list for a specific Workflow Channel).</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you return to the list, the new workflow channel will be in either the published or unpublished state that was selected when prompted.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Workflow Channels: Unpublish (Case 36238)&#160;</p>
        <p>The Workflow Channel system has been updated to make the publishing of workflow channels&#160;more consistent with&#160;other publishing functions.&#160;The Workflow Channels list now displays published Workflow Channels by default&#160;when initially opened. Unpublished Workflow Channels can be viewed by clicking&#160;<strong>Unpublished</strong>&#160;in the More search or by toggling the Status chiclet to <strong>Unpublished</strong>.&#160;When viewing the Workflow Channels list, you can view both published and unpublished from <strong>More</strong>&#160;search &gt; <strong>All</strong>. Alternatively, while viewing the list, you can remove the <strong>Status</strong> chiclet.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Workflow Channel: Visualize (Case 37021)&#160;</p>
        <p>The&#160;<strong>Visualize&#160;</strong>system in Workflow Channel creation has been enhanced.&#160;Child workflow items are now displayed in the visualizer in the following format:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">#&lt;Item Number&gt;: &lt;Item Name&gt;</p>
        <p>This format matches the format used in the header of the workflow item detail, making the system easier to use.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Workflow Channel: Publish/Unpublish (Case 37029)&#160;<img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_FunctionalChange.png" title="Change in functionality" alt="Change in functionality" /></p>
        <p>Workflow Channels have been enhanced to simplify the publish and unpublish process.&#160;The Workflow Channel list now contains a <strong>Publish</strong> check box in the rightmost column.&#160;Select the <strong>Publish</strong> check box to publish the channel. Clear the <strong>Publish</strong> check box to unpublish a channel. The formatting changes to bold and italics for an unpublished state.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Business Rules (Case 37121)&#160;</p>
        <p>Business Rules management has been enhanced to allow user datatypes as triggering conditions during configuration.&#160;When&#160;configuring a new business rule, the Primary Trigger Field and Secondary Trigger Field now include User datatype fields.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>Trigger value fields&#160;are text fields that support the following configurations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A single&#160;User ID</li>
            <li>#IsDirty</li>
            <li>#IsEmpty</li>
            <li>#IsDirtyAndEmpty</li>
            <li>#IsDirtyAndNotEmpty</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SubHdr">Email Templates: Publish/Unpublish (Case 37174)&#160;</p>
        <p>Email Templates have been enhanced to simplify the publish and unpublish process.&#160;The Email Template list now contains a <strong>Publish</strong> check box in the rightmost column.&#160;Select the <strong>Publish</strong> check box to publish the template. Clear the <strong>Publish</strong> check box to unpublish a template. The formatting changes to bold and italics for an unpublished state.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Case Discussions (Case 37283)&#160;</p>
        <p>Case Discussion has been enhanced, adding the ability to switch between an employee’s work and personal email after a discussion has been started.&#160;Previously when an employee was added as a discussion recipient, after the message was sent, that employee would need to be removed and added back if the user wanted to change their email from Work to Personal or vice versa.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Benefits reconciliation (Case 37306)&#160;</p>
        <p>The Auto Reconcile process for Benefits reconciliation has been converted to our cross-browser compatible NEXT system.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Email Templates: Publish when Finish (Case 37390)&#160;</p>
        <p>The Email Template system has been enhanced to include auto-publish functionality.&#160;As a final step of email template configuration,&#160;when you click <strong>Finish</strong>, a&#160;dialog box opens with "This email template is currently unpublished. Would you like to publish?" Click <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>.&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yes</strong> returns the admin to the Email Template search page with the Email Template in a published state.&#160;</li>
            <li><strong>No</strong> returns the admin to the Email Template search page with the Email Template in an unpublished state.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SubHdr">Workflow Channels: Improved selection options (Case 37440)&#160;</p>
        <p>Workflow channels have been enhanced to improve the selection options when cloning a dataform&#160;user field. When cloning a user datatype in a workflow, the admin is now presented with a dialog box that provides the option to select&#160;<strong>Current User</strong>,&#160;<strong>Specific User</strong>, or&#160;<strong>From a Field on a Form</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When selected, <strong>From a Field on a Form</strong> includes the triggering form for that workflow.</li>
            <li>If a user datatype is not configured in a workflow channel, it defaults to business logic for setting that field, if applicable.</li>
            <li>On a Case, the system ensures if the Assigned To is not configured on a workflow channel, business logic configured on the corresponding Case Type is used to fill the field, including Back Up Assigned To for a Client Role.</li>
            <li>Cloning a user datatype field with configuration does NOT take precedence over business logic unless a specific business rule is written to avoid overwriting values set by workflow. Specifically, the PEO client service case has a method called SetAssignedtoUser that should defer to the Assigned To user set by the workflow.</li>
            <li>If a user datatype is cloneable, but not configured, it renders a <strong>None</strong>. The system then defaults to business logic and works as if it is not cloneable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This development also includes a script to convert existing user field values to a <strong>SpecificUser</strong> type.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Modules: Email Addin configuration (Case 37451)&#160;</p>
        <p>The Modules administration area has been enhanced to configure Email Addin modules.&#160;Using the field <strong>Email Addin Configuration</strong>, you can configure email to dataform mappings to fill fields in the newly created case or task using data from the selected email. Case or task fields are paired with email fields (use a SystemField=EmailField format).&#160;The pairings are semicolon separated with no spaces between them and no ending semicolon.</p>
        <p>For example: <strong>Subject=Subject;CaseInfo=Body;EmailAddress=Sender;z_ClientReportDate=DateSent</strong></p>
        <p>The following Email fields are available for use in the configuration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DateSent</li>
            <li>Subject</li>
            <li>Body</li>
            <li>Sender</li>
            <li>Recipient</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SubHdr">Address change notification (Case 37501)&#160;</p>
        <p>The recipient stored procedure&#160;<strong>peo_employee_emailtemplate_recipient_v2_proc</strong> has been updated to return employee information when an email template triggers from an Employee or an Employment form.&#160;Previously this stored procedure would only return employee data if triggered by the Employee dataform.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Pulse configurations (Case 37528)&#160;</p>
        <p>A new online Help guide for Case Discussions has been added to the Case form.</p>
        <p>The following new email templates and&#160;workflow channels&#160;have also been added. The new templates and channels are unpublished and can be individually customized before publishing.</p>
        <p>Workflow additions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PHR: Employee Address Change - triggered by an employee address change</li>
            <li>PHR: Employee SSN Change - triggered by an employee SSN change</li>
            <li>PHR: Employee Status Change - triggered when the employment status changes</li>
            <li>PHR: Employment Type Change - triggered by a change to employment type (FT/PT)</li>
            <li>PHR: Employee Rate Change - triggered by&#160;an employee pay rate change</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Email Template additions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PHR: Employee Address Change - triggered by an employee address change</li>
            <li>PHR: Employee SSN Change - triggered by an employee SSN change</li>
            <li>PHR: Employee Status Change - triggered when the employment status changes</li>
            <li>PHR: Employment Type Change - triggered by a change to employment type (FT/PT)</li>
            <li>PHR: Employee Pay Rate Change&#160;- triggered by&#160;an employee pay rate change</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SubHdr">New Billing Code Lookup Group (Case 37560)&#160;</p>
        <p>A new lookup group and associated lookups and metadata have been created for the Billing Code information. The new lookup group resolves an issue where previously the same Lookup group was being used with Vouchers. The decode should and could be changed when using Payroll Batches, but when the same lookup is also used for importing pay vouchers, the decode should not be changed because it is used with the import mapping API path.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Default Workspace for Employee Portal cases and PrismHR events (Case 37630)&#160;</p>
        <p>A default Client Services Department workspace has been created. This workspace is used during case creation from the Employee Portal if the system is unable to find a match for the Client Number of the related PrismHR employee.&#160; The system has also been enhanced to utilize this workspace for PrismHR Event records that are created when a match cannot be found for the PrismHR Client Number.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Configurable introduction and confirmation text for the Employee Portal Case Widget (Case 37701)&#160;</p>
        <p>Two new fields have been added to the third-party integration section of the configuration page of the admin workspace.&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Employee Portal Introduction message </strong>allows&#160;the system administrator to configure the message that appears at the top of the dialog when creating a case from the Employee Portal.&#160;&#160;</li>
            <li><strong>Employee Portal Confirmation message</strong>&#160;allows the system administrator to configure the message that appears when saving a case from the Employee Portal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SubHdr">Salesforce API (Case 37825)&#160;</p>
        <p>The Salesforce API has been enhanced to include Opportunity fields on the initial creation of the Organization. Previously the Organization was created using account fields on the first pass; then more details were added during subsequent Salesforce API synchronizations, using the opportunity information from Salesforce.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Field display logic for blank values (Case 37936)&#160;</p>
        <p>Field display has been enhanced to allow for triggering conditions where the trigger field is a blank value.&#160;The <strong>equals this value</strong> field is no longer required.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaving the <strong>equals this value</strong> field blank is now accepted and correctly evaluated.</li>
            <li>Help text has been updated to include assistance with using a blank value.</li>
            <li>This applies to both <strong>State</strong> and <strong>Style</strong> field display rules.</li>
            <li><strong>equals this value</strong> can be a comma-separated list of values; values can include a blank (see the following scenarios for actions taken).</li>
            <li>When using a comma, if there is no value before or after the comma, it is interpreted as a blank value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Configurations are interpreted as follows:</p>

        <p>Email templates have been enhanced to include a typeahead interface for conditions using a lookup or parent form field as the triggering field.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Ben Recon conversion (Case 37990)&#160;</p>
        <p>The Ben Recon View Matches, View Exceptions, and Analysis tools have been converted to work with our cross-browser compatible NEXT system.</p>
        <p class="SubHdr">Workflow Channels: User Type (Case 38110)&#160;</p>
        <p>The Workflow cloning functionality has been updated for user type fields. Previously, if a User field was created during workflow channel cloning, but the field was not configured in the workflow channel, the field would default to the current user.&#160;The functionality has been updated. If a user field is included in a workflow channel but is not configured, the system defaults the user field to <strong>None</strong>.</p>
