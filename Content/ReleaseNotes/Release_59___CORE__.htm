                        <p>Configurable Field Display has been enhanced with a new field called Type (lookup - options &#160;Field Style, Field State).</p>
                        <p>When "Style" is selected, field label styling may be configured so a field label can be styled differently based on conditions on the dataform - for example:</p>
                        <p>The label of a field could be set to different colors including Bold and underlined based on another field on the form such as a lookup denoting Client Satisfaction.&#160; As the system supports multiple Style configurations, the field label in question could change to a different color for each lookup value in the list.</p>

                        <p>When adding a new Org, if any possible dupes are found, a new "Request Review"&#160;button will appear on the dupe&#160;check dialog.</p>
                        <p>Clicking this button will allow the user to request a review. This will insert a record into into tblDuplicateOrgReview (new table - the associated dashboard module&#160;is called "Org Dup Requests"). You&#160;can search and view the duplicate requests in this new module.</p>
                        <p>Most of the fields are read-only, but global admins can change the assigned-to and the status. The assigned-to user will see the accept and decline links (global admins will see these as well). If the user accepts, the org will be created based on what the original user submitted if the accepting user has "<strong>CRM_CanSaveDuplicates</strong>" rights. If the assigned-to declines, it updates the status of the request to "Declined" and does not create an org.</p>
                        <p>Components in this development:</p>
