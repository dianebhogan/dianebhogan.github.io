                        <p>The workflow system has been enhanced with the following:</p>
                        <p>Workflow configuration has been reduced from 5 steps to 4 in order to streamline the process.&#160;&#160;</p>
                        <p>The ability to add triggered dataform cloning has been added, allowing you to generate pre-filled system dataforms based on workflow triggering conditions</p>
                        <p>The Workflow channels system now morphs based on the generated content type (Task or Form) which you select, presenting appropriate configuration options.&#160;&#160;</p>
