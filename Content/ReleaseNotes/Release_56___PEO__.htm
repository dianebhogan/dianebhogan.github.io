                        <hr />
                        <p>A&#160;new business rule has been created to auto-generate a new Client Visit record.&#160; This is determined via metadata on the "TypeOfVisit" lookup (see below). This rule will get triggered when the Visit status =&#160; "Completed".</p>
                        <p>The following fields are set&#160;on the new record as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visit Type, default from the Client Visit record that is getting cloned.</li>
                            <li>Visit Department, default from the Client Visit record that is getting cloned.</li>
                            <li>Visited By, default from the Client Visit record that is getting cloned.</li>
                            <li>Visit Status, default to "Planned".</li>
                            <li>Client Contact, default from the Client Visit record that is getting cloned.</li>
                            <li>Location,default from the Client Visit record that is getting cloned.</li>
                            <li>Appointment Date, defaults to X number of days out from cloned visit date&#160;based on the Visit Frequency field specified in the rule. If value can't be determined then do not create the new record.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>TYPE OF VISIT METADATA<br />3 new fields have been added&#160;to the existing metadata on the "TypeOfVisit" lookup to specify whether the next Visit record should get auto-created. If so, which Dataform and Field should be used to retrieve the Next Visit Frequency.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Auto-create Next Visit has been added as a Yes, No lookup with a Default of&#160;No. If Yes, then the system will display the next 2 fields.</li>
                            <li>In a new fieldset called "Next Visit Setting"&#160;the following fields have been added:<ul><li>Dataform for Frequency, Enable field and require if Create Next Visit = Yes</li><li>Field for Frequency, Enable field and require if Create Next Visit = Yes.</li></ul></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A&#160;new business rule has been created to ensure the Dataform for Frequency that is selected is a single dataform and ensure the Field for Frequency that is selected is using the existing "Visit Schedule" lookup group.</p>
                        <p>VISIT SCHEDULE METADATA<br />A&#160;new metadata form&#160;has been added&#160;to the Visit Schedule Lookup Group to capture the number of days for given period.&#160;The field&#160;"Days per Frequency" has been added to this form and&#160;the following values and set day added as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Monthly (30)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>VISIT DATAFORM CHANGES<br />A&#160;"Visit Complete Date"&#160; field has been added to the Client Visit form.&#160; It is read-only and&#160;is set to the date that the Status is changed to Completed.</p>
