                        <p>You are now&#160;able to configure the merge to run&#160;from the employee form with no filter,&#160;where it will run for that employee, and from the client master, where it will show the filter page.</p>

                        <hr />
                        <p>ClientSpace pricing has been enhanced to display the underlying process behind the scenes when you click "Generate Pricing" while initially creating pricing in a workspace. The system now displays a running dialog as it Validates the codes and states, creates the codes in the workspace and finalizes pricing before finally reloading the pricing console. The maximum limit of 15 state-code combinations has also been removed.</p>

                        <hr />
                        <p>The pricing console in NEXT has been enhanced to allow you to pre-load data into the pricing grid via a pre-formatted CSV template. This template is available from the "Get Template" button under the Preload dialog (Sample template file must be uploaded under PEO Configuration in the Admin Workspace | CS PEO Configuration dataform).</p>
                        <p>Completing this template with state, code and payroll information and uploading via the dialog will pre-fill the Quick Add Grid, providing a quick method for adding large numbers of Codes to initial pricing and exposing the "Generate Pricing" button.</p>
                        <p>The maximum cap for adding codes and states to a pricing batch has also been removed as State-Code combinations are processed one at a time now, allowing for larger pricing batches to be created.&#160;</p>

                        <p>The Full time and part time employee fields in the QuickEdit control of the pricing console have been capped with a maximum Employee count of 5000 each. Exceeding this value will present a message to the user that the Employee count is not to exceed 5000. &#160;This is to avoid an error during pricing calculations when extremely large numbers were added for employee counts, causing the calculations to ovrerun the max field value for some pricing fields.</p>
