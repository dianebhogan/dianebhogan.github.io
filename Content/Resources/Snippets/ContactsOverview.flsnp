        <p>Through Contact records you can maintain detailed information about your clients or potential clients used during the sales process and after, avoiding the need to create a user account in the system. Contact records hold information about people that work for client companies – companies that are in a co-employment relationship. The contact can be an employee, IT staff, third-party vendors, and so on.   Contact information can be imported from external systems such as Salesforce and PrismHR. </p>
