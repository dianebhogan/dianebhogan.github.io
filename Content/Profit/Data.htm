        <h1>Data </h1>
        <p>Much of the data for gross profitability comes directly from PrismHR.
We will look at a Payroll Batch
and the many Billing Vouchers within the batch. Let's use the client Fairfield Financial for our example.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Historical data may not be available as of Release 89. Please engage with <MadCap:variable name="MyVariables.ProductName" /> Professional Services for an interim solution.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To view the data that drives the process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the client's workspace landing page.</li>
            <li>Move to the end of the page, and search for <span class="UXElement">payroll</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/Profitability/WorkspaceLanding_payroll.png" alt="" title="" class="thumbnail" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <span class="UXElement">Payroll Batch</span>.<br />The Payroll Batch list displays, showing records for multiple pay dates. These entries are payroll runs, showing the Pay Date.</li>
            <li>Double-click a record to open and view the Payroll Batch.<br />You see Pay Date, Pay Group (could have multiple Pay Groups), Period End Date, and Employee Count. </li>
            <li>In the <span class="UXElement">Action Center</span>, click <span class="UXElement">Billing Vouchers</span>.<br />Each Payroll Batch has multiple Billing Voucher records. These are line items for the invoice to include Gross Wages, FICA, State taxes, Administrator fees, and Workers' Compensation.</li>
        </ol>
