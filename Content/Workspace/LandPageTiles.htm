        <p>Landing page tiles are a series of panels at the top of the Workspace Landing Page, some of which can expand to reveal more information as indicated by an inverse caret, which can be selected to further expand the panel.</p>
        <p>Many of these tiles expand for a more detailed view of the information or underlying dataform. This is generally indicated by an icon in the header of the individual tiles. Currently, expanding a single form or dashboard in the system such as the pricing console is indicated by <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Jump.png" /> (<b>Jump</b>),  whereas opening a multiform record is indicated by <img src="../Resources/Images/ICONS/ICON_Search.png" /> (<b>Search</b>).&#160;</p>
